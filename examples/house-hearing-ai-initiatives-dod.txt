                          United States Senate,    
                   Subcommittee on Emerging
                          Threats and Capabilities,
                               Committee on Armed Services,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:37 p.m. in 
room SR-232A, Russell Senate Office Building, Senator Joni 
Ernst (Chairman of the Subcommittee) presiding.
    Members present: Senators Ernst, Shaheen, Heinrich, and 
Peters.

            OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR JONI ERNST

    Senator Ernst. The Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and 
Capabilities meets today to receive testimony on Department of 
Defense artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives.
    I want to thank you, gentlemen, for being here today.
    I do apologize. We have a vote series going on right now, 
so, at some point, Senator Peters and I may have to switch on 
and off. We'll run down and vote accordingly.
    But, I do want to thank you for being here. I'd love to 
welcome you. We have a very distinguished panel joining us 
today, ladies and gentlemen.
    As highlighted in the NDS [National Defense Strategy] 
Commission Report, the U.S. must stay ahead in several emerging 
technologies in order to maintain or regain a warfighting 
advantage. These technologies include hypersonics, directed 
energy, artificial intelligence, 5G, and quantum computing. 
Russia and China are aggressively developing these capabilities 
and, in some cases, have already surpassed, or will soon 
surpass, our technologies. Without action, the U.S. may find 
itself at a technological disadvantage in future conflicts.
    Over the next few months, this Subcommittee will focus our 
efforts to ensure the Department is well positioned to outpace 
our adversaries and maintain a strategic advantage in these key 
technologies. Today, we will focus on one technology of 
particular importance, which is artificial intelligence.
    The recently released Department of Defense Artificial 
Intelligence Strategy makes clear AI is poised to transform 
every industry and is expected to impact every corner of the 
Department, spanning operations, training, sustainment, force 
protection, recruiting, healthcare, and many others. AI has the 
ability to provide powerful new capabilities to our warfighters 
that we are only beginning to imagine. When applied to back-
office functions and operations within the Department, AI will 
be critical in boosting efficiency and increasing the 
effectiveness of limited resources. With such broad potential 
impacts, it is important that the Department move quickly to 
adopt these capabilities so that we don't lose the 
technological edge.
    Our adversaries understand the critical importance of AI. 
Last year, the Chinese government released a strategy detailing 
its plan to take the lead in AI by 2030. Less than 2 months 
later, Vladimir Putin publicly announced Russia's intent to 
pursue AI technologies, stating, ``Whoever becomes the leader 
in this field will rule the world.'' Both of these countries 
are investing heavily in military applications of AI to achieve 
a warfighting advantage.
    The United States is also investing heavily in AI 
applications. Over the last year, the Department has initiated 
several important efforts to accelerate the adoption of AI, 
including the establishment of the Joint AI Center, or JAIC, 
the development of a DARPA [Defense Advanced Research Projects 
Agency] AI Next Campaign, and the release of the DOD 
[Department of Defense] AI Strategy. These efforts demonstrate 
the extent of the AI transformation already underway within the 
Department of Defense and the priority that is being placed on 
growing these capabilities. However, with these important 
efforts comes the challenge of coordinating hundreds of 
disparate AI efforts across multiple offices and organizations. 
I look to our witnesses to help the committee better understand 
how AI can be adopted more rapidly, how coordinating the 
initiatives already underway within the Department can help us 
harness this powerful technology, and where we must invest in 
future research to ensure we maintain a long-term advantage.
    Again, I thank our witnesses for being with us today. I 
look forward to their testimony.
    I would turn to my Ranking Member, Mr. Peters. Senator 
Peters, thank you. New Ranking Member joining us. This is our 
first subcommittee hearing of the Congress. Senator Peters, I 
welcome you onboard. Thank you very much.

              STATEMENT OF SENATOR GARY C. PETERS

    Senator Peters. Well, Madam Chairwoman, thank you. It's an 
honor to be with you. I've enjoyed working with you over the 
years, and we'll continue to do that in the next 2 years in 
this Congress.
    Also, I'd like to thank the gentlemen for you being here 
today, for your testimony.
    You know, artificial intelligence is already impacting our 
daily lives through commercial products and services, from 
applications as simple as Alexa to very complex systems, like 
self-driving automobiles. AI has huge implications for our 
national security, as well. For example, it'll enable new 
capabilities in intelligence analysis, autonomous systems, as 
well as cybersecurity. At the same time, AI can create new 
threats in these and other areas that can be exploited by our 
adversaries. I hope, in this hearing, that we can hear from our 
witnesses on the Pentagon's efforts to position itself in the 
rapidly changing world of AI, from the more near-term 
activities of the Joint AI Center to the long-term, high-risk, 
high-payoff research efforts of DARPA and the Defense 
Innovation Unit (DIU).
    The current AI systems that exist today only exist because 
of decades of research in computer science, control systems, 
microelectronics, and other fields. There are many amazing 
commercial capabilities available today, yet AI is still 
relatively primitive to what we all think it can be. We need to 
continue to invest in fields like computer science and 
electronics, but also research in areas such as our 
understanding of how machines and people learn and can work 
together to make sure that that promise becomes a reality.
    I would like to understand how the DOD is working to move 
AI capabilities quickly into fielded systems, as well as how 
the Pentagon is developing a long-range strategy on R&D 
[research and development] of new capabilities.
    I hope we can discuss how we are engaging with the best 
minds in defense and the commercial industry, Silicon Valley, 
government labs, and universities to address many of these 
challenges.
    I would also like to learn about efforts to ensure that the 
DOD and the Nation has the expert workforce that we will need 
within government to stay at the leading edge of this 
technology.
    Finally, I'd like to recognize--General Shanahan is a 
distinguished graduate of the University of Michigan, earning 
his commission there through the ROTC [Reserve Officer Training 
Corps]. The University of Michigan is one of many academic 
institutions in Michigan that prioritizes artificial 
intelligence research, particularly for the development and 
testing of autonomous vehicle systems.
    General Shanahan, I know that U of M [University of 
Michigan] would love to host you back on campus to see the work 
that they're doing on AI and on autonomy and its relevance to 
your work. I hope that you and--as well as our other members of 
the panel, are able to take a trip to Michigan sometime soon.
    I thank the Chair again for holding this hearing. I 
certainly look forward to our discussion.
    Senator Ernst. Yes. Thank you very much, Senator Peters.
    We will start with Dr. Peter T. Highnam. Dr. Highnam became 
the Deputy Director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects 
Agency, what we know of as DARPA, in February of 2018. Prior to 
coming to DARPA, Dr. Highnam was the Director of Research at 
the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, on assignment from 
the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI). 
Prior to that assignment, he also served 6 years at ODNI's 
Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity, initially as 
an Office Director and then as Director.
    Dr. Highnam, we welcome you. You may start your opening 
remarks. Thank you very much.

    STATEMENT OF PETER T. HIGHNAM, DEPUTY DIRECTOR, DEFENSE 
               ADVANCED RESEARCH PROJECTS AGENCY

    Dr. Highnam. Thank you, Chairwoman Ernst, Ranking Member 
Peters. I'm pleased to be here to represent the Defense 
Advanced Research Projects Agency and share with the 
Subcommittee DARPA's work to advance AI technologies.
    I'm going to begin with a little bit about DARPA's history 
in this field. In 1960, shortly after DARPA was created, ARPA 
[Advanced Research Projects Agency] was created. One of the 
first information technology offices that we had gave this 
quote, ``It seems reasonable to envision bringing computing 
machines effectively into processes of thinking that must go on 
in realtime, time that moves too fast to permit using computers 
in conventional ways. To think in interaction with a computer 
in the same way that you think with a colleague whose 
competence supplements your own will require much tighter 
coupling between man and machine than is possible today.''
    Back then, when computers were large, were room-size, when 
they were being used for computing missile trajectories and so 
on, this man saw what was possible, saw the insights that were 
becoming available, and saw the push that we're still working 
on, which is changing computers from tools to partners. That 
actually is the history of AI investments by DARPA for the last 
60 years.
    That is also quintessential DARPA. This man had, you know, 
one foot in defense, seeing the mission and seeing what was 
needed, and one foot in the technology side, and framed the 
problem using use cases, knew what had to be done, and started 
driving. It's unlikely that he thought that there would be 6 
decades of investments and hard work that followed that to get 
to where we are today.
    I'd like to say that, after 60 years of pushing, AI is an 
overnight success.
    [Laughter.]
    Dr. Highnam. Really, within the last 10 years, when you 
think about the kind of technologies. A lot of transitions and 
successes over the decades, much accomplished, and much still 
to do.
    DARPA describes the investments in AI using a waves 
construct. The first wave at the beginning, for the first 20 
years or so, are normally known as describe. This is where 
knowledge was encoded in rules, ``If A, then B.'' If you look 
inside the tax--if you do personal taxes today, there's a rule-
based system inside there that was what, 40 years ago, would 
have been called AI technologies, now is just computer science, 
or IT [information technology]. That's the price of success. 
It's no longer AI. It's just commonplace.
    Then, beginning in the mid-1970s, the technology--science 
had put in place to begin what became machine learning. The 
theory was put down, but it--only in the last 10-15 years, we 
now have the compute cycles, we have the data availability. 
That's when the current wave, the second wave, of machine 
learning really took place and really came into being.
    Now we're looking past that, at DARPA, into what comes 
next. We have two waves of technology. One was descriptive, one 
was recognizing situations, classifying, and so on. Now we have 
to be able to explain, to really build the trust between these 
systems and the people who are using them and working with them 
in realtime, in difficult, stressful situations, but building 
the trust so that they really can become partners. This is the 
role of explanation.
    It's a great time to be at DARPA, because we're now on the 
brink of a lot of really exciting things. That's the genesis of 
the current initiative, the $2 billion investment that we've 
said we're now making in AI technologies.
    That said, there's a brittleness to the current 
technologies. The tools are immature, still. We don't have an 
engineering discipline behind AI technologies. There are 
issues, that I'm sure everyone will talk to you about, about 
missing data volume, missing data quality, provenance, and so 
on, the training, second-wave systems. These systems tend to 
have unexpected failure modes.
    In front of you, there should be an example of the 
brittleness of AI. These are drawn from the academia mixture. 
You may have seen these before. In the first picture, on the 
left, there's a panda, which you and I look at with all the 
history that we have of looking at these critters. On the right 
is also a picture that looks like a panda, as well, to us. The 
difference is that, in the digital representation, a certain 
amount of ``noise'' represented by the middle picture was laid 
on top of it, and a highly trained second-wave classification 
system, machine-learning system, went from classifying that 
picture as a panda to now as a gibbon, with high certainty. The 
fragility of these methods--these are very literal methods. 
There is no semantics, there is no intelligence.
    The second example is perhaps of more concern. This shows a 
stop sign in a physical situation. Think autonomous vehicles. 
To you and I, again, it's a stop sign. It has a certain shape. 
To a trained system, to a highly trained system, it's no 
longer--when you put that little white sticker--or that yellow 
sticker onto the stop sign, it's now classified as a speed 
limit sign. You can think in terms of autonomous vehicles, the 
brittleness and fragility of the systems. You can also think in 
terms of adversarial endeavors. It takes camouflage and 
deception to a whole new level.
    Very important to point those things out.
    Today we have autonomy. We have a lot of work successes in 
cyber, from first- and second-wave technologies. We have novel 
hardware, high-performance hardware, low-energy hardware coming 
into place. Yes, then we have a lot of tools, and hundreds of 
thousands of people are being trained and really wanting to use 
machine learning. We have to go to the next step, this 
commonsense reasoning, being able to explain where this 
inference came from. We have to get there. Otherwise, trust 
won't come into place.
    What we've done is to talk about, in our new initiative, 
robust AI, dealing with adversarial AI, both unintentional and 
intentional, high-performance, in terms of compute cycles and 
minimizing energy, and delivering radically new capabilities. 
This is the genesis of the AI Next Campaign, creating systems 
capable of reasoning, regenerative, contextual, and explanatory 
models. We already have over 20 programs running in AI, new 
programs--research programs started. We have over 80 programs 
in the agency. About one-third of the programs in the entire 
agency now are either creating AI technologies or aggressive 
users of those technologies.
    Last, to your point about workforce, we really had to get 
more people engaged. Typically, we put out a call for 
proposals--research proposals, people apply, and, 6 to 9 months 
later, if selected, they're on contract. We have something 
called AI Exploration, by which we are driving the research 
community to explore this--the space of the third wave 
aggressively. We post a topic, and we award contracts within 90 
days of posting the topic. We've now done this six times. We've 
invested, so far, on the order of $45 million in this. There's 
tremendous uptake from the research community, these 
opportunities. All unclassified, all fundamental work.
    From 60 years ago to now, I don't think Mr. Licklider, at 
the time, would have anticipated that the Department of Defense 
would have an AI strategy, such a huge success in recognition, 
and that the President would sign an AI executive order. Who 
would have thought?
    Game-changing capabilities for the Defense Department and 
the world, from 60 years of investment, much accomplished, and 
much to do.
    Thank you.
    [The prepared statement of Dr. Peter Highnam follows:]

                Prepared Statement by Dr. Peter Highnam
      darpa's seminal role in the field of artificial intelligence
    Seventy years ago, when early electronic computers ran on vacuum 
tubes and filled entire rooms, researchers already were striving to 
enable machines to think as people do. Only a few years after its start 
in 1958, DARPA began playing a central role in realizing this ambition 
by laying some of the groundwork for the field of artificial 
intelligence (AI). Early work in AI emphasized handcrafted knowledge, 
and computer scientists constructed so-called expert systems that 
captured the rules that the system could then apply to situations of 
interest. Such ``first wave'' AI technologies were quite successful--
tax preparation software is a good example of an expert system--but the 
need to handcraft rules is costly and time-consuming and therefore 
limits the applicability of rules-based AI technologies.
    The past few years have seen an explosion of interest in a sub-
field of AI dubbed ``machine learning'' that applies statistical and 
probabilistic methods to large data sets to create generalized 
representations that can be applied to future samples. Foremost among 
these approaches are deep learning (artificial) neural networks trained 
to perform a variety of classification and prediction tasks when 
adequate historical data is available. Therein lies the rub, however, 
as the task of collecting, labelling, and vetting data on which to 
train such ``second wave'' AI techniques is prohibitively costly and 
time-consuming.
    DARPA envisions a future in which machines are more than just tools 
that execute human-programmed rules or generalize from human-curated 
data sets. Rather, the machines DARPA envisions will function more as 
colleagues than as tools. Towards this end, DARPA is focusing its 
investments on a ``third wave'' of AI technologies that brings forth 
machines that can reason in context. Incorporating these technologies 
in military systems that collaborate with warfighters will facilitate 
better decisions in complex, time-critical, battlefield environments; 
enable a shared understanding of massive, incomplete, and contradictory 
information; and empower unmanned systems to perform critical missions 
safely and with high degrees of autonomy.
    Today, DARPA is funding more than 24 programs exploring ways to 
advance the state of the art in AI, pushing beyond second wave machine 
learning towards contextual reasoning capabilities. This is in addition 
to more than 55 active programs that are leveraging machine learning or 
AI technologies in some capacity-from managing the electromagnetic 
spectrum to detecting and patching cyber vulnerabilities.
    This level of investment has been years in the making and will 
define scientific and technical exploration, as well as resulting 
military capabilities, for decades to come.
                            current programs
    DARPA's Lifelong Learning Machines (L2M) program is exploring ways 
to enable machines to learn while doing without catastrophic 
forgetting. Such a capability would enable systems to improve on the 
fly, recover from surprises, and keep them from drifting out of sync 
with the world. First announced in 2017, L2M research teams are 
developing complete systems and their components, as well as exploring 
learning mechanisms in biological organisms with the goal of 
translating them into computational processes. Discoveries in both 
technical areas are expected to generate new methodologies that will 
allow AI systems to learn and improve during tasks, apply previous 
skills and knowledge to new situations, incorporate innate system 
limits, and enhance safety in automated assignments. While the program 
is still in its early stages, L2M researchers already have identified 
and solved challenges associated with building and training a self-
reproducing neural network.
    DARPA is also currently running a program called Explainable AI or 
XAI to develop new machine-learning architectures that can produce 
accurate explanations of their decisions in a form that makes sense to 
humans. As AI algorithms become more widely used, reasonable self-
explanation will help users understand how these systems work, and how 
much to trust them in various situations. XAI specifically aims to 
create a suite of machine learning techniques that produce explainable 
models--while maintaining a high level of prediction accuracy so human 
users understand, appropriately trust, and effectively manage the 
emerging generation of artificially intelligent partners. Enabling 
computing systems in this manner is critical because sensor, 
information, and communication systems generate data at rates beyond 
what humans can assimilate, understand, and act upon.
    The real breakthrough for artificial intelligence, however, will 
not come until researchers figure out a way for machines to learn or 
otherwise acquire common sense. Without common sense, AI systems will 
be powerful but limited tools that require human inputs to function. 
With common sense, an AI could become a partner in problem solving. 
Common sense knowledge is so pervasive in our lives that it can be hard 
to recognize. For example, in conflict and warzone situations, people 
tend to make snap decisions about the cause of the problem and ignore 
evidence that does not support their point of view. To act as a valued 
partner in such situations, the AI system will need sufficient common 
sense to know when to speak and what to say, which will require that it 
have a good idea of what each person knows. Interrupting to state the 
obvious would quickly result in its deactivation, particularly under 
stressful conditions.
    In order to find answers to the common sense problem, DARPA 
launched in October of last year the Machine Common Sense (MCS) 
program, which will explore recent advances in cognitive understanding, 
natural language processing, deep learning, and other areas of AI 
research. MCS is pursuing two approaches for developing and evaluating 
different machine common sense services. The first approach seeks to 
create computational models that learn from experience and mimic the 
core domains of cognition as defined by developmental psychology. This 
includes the domains of objects (intuitive physics), places (spatial 
navigation), and agents (intentional actors). Researchers will develop 
systems that think and learn as humans do in the very early stages of 
development, leveraging advances in the field of cognitive development 
to provide empirical and theoretical guidance.
    To assess the progress and success of the first strategy's 
computational models, researchers will explore developmental psychology 
research studies and literature to create evaluation criteria. DARPA 
will use the resulting set of cognitive development milestones to 
determine how well the models are able to learn against three levels of 
performance: prediction/expectation, experience learning, and problem 
solving.
    The second MCS approach will construct a common sense knowledge 
repository capable of answering natural language and image-based 
queries about common sense phenomena by reading from the Web. DARPA 
expects that researchers will use a combination of manual construction, 
information extraction, machine learning, crowdsourcing techniques, and 
other computational approaches to develop the repository. The resulting 
capability will be measured against the Allen Institute for Artificial 
Intelligence (AI2) Common sense benchmark tests, which are constructed 
through an extensive crowdsourcing process to represent and measure the 
broad common sense knowledge of an average adult.
                            ai next campaign
    DARPA announced in September 2018, a multi-year investment of more 
than $2 billion in new and existing programs called the ``AI Next'' 
campaign. Campaign key areas include providing robust foundations for 
second wave technologies, aggressively applying second wave AI 
technologies into appropriate systems, and exploring and creating third 
wave AI science and technologies.
    AI Next builds on DARPA's five decades of AI technology creation to 
define and to shape the future, always with the Department's hardest 
problems in mind. Accordingly, DARPA will create powerful capabilities 
for the DoD by attending specifically to the following areas:
    New Capabilities: AI technologies are applied routinely to enable 
DARPA R&D projects, including more than 60 ongoing programs, such as 
the Electronic Resurgence Initiative, and other programs related to 
real-time analysis of sophisticated cyber attacks, detection of 
fraudulent imagery, construction of dynamic kill-chains for all-domain 
warfare, human language technologies, multi-modality automatic target 
recognition, biomedical advances, and control of prosthetic limbs. 
DARPA will advance AI technologies to enable automation of critical 
Department business processes. One such process is the lengthy 
accreditation of software systems prior to operational deployment. 
Automating this accreditation process with known AI and other 
technologies now appears possible.
    Robust AI: AI technologies have demonstrated great value to 
missions as diverse as space-based imagery analysis, cyber attack 
warning, supply chain logistics and analysis of microbiologic systems. 
At the same time, the failure modes of AI technologies are poorly 
understood. DARPA is working to address this shortfall, with focused 
R&D, both analytic and empirical. DARPA's success is essential for the 
Department to deploy AI technologies, particularly to the tactical 
edge, where reliable performance is required.
    Adversarial AI: The most powerful AI tool today is machine 
learning. Machine learning systems are easily duped by changes to 
inputs that would never fool a human. The data used to train such 
systems can be corrupted, and the software itself is vulnerable to 
cyber attack. These areas, and more, must be addressed at scale as more 
AI-enabled systems are operationally deployed.
    High Performance AI: Computer performance increases over the last 
decade have enabled the success of machine learning, in combination 
with large data sets, and software libraries. More performance at lower 
electrical power is essential to allow both data center and tactical 
deployments. DARPA has demonstrated analog processing of AI algorithms 
with 1000 times speedup and 1000 times power efficiency over state-of-
the-art digital processors, and is researching AI-specific hardware 
designs. DARPA is also attacking the current inefficiency of machine 
learning, by researching methods to drastically reduce requirements for 
labeled training data.
    Next Generation AI: The machine learning algorithms that enable 
face recognition and self-driving vehicles were invented over 20 years 
ago. DARPA has taken the lead in pioneering research to develop the 
next generation of AI algorithms, which will transform computers from 
tools into problem-solving partners. DARPA research aims to enable AI 
systems to explain their actions, and to acquire and reason with common 
sense knowledge. DARPA R&D produced the first AI successes, such as 
expert systems and search, and more recently has advanced machine 
learning tools and hardware.
    In addition to new and ongoing DARPA research, a key component of 
the AI Next campaign will be DARPA's Artificial Intelligence 
Exploration (AIE) program, first announced in July 2018. AIE 
constitutes a series of high-risk, high payoff projects where 
researchers work to establish the feasibility of new AI concepts within 
18 months of award. Leveraging streamlined contracting procedures and 
funding mechanisms enables these efforts to move from proposal to 
project kick-off within 3 months of an opportunity announcement.
                               conclusion
    Over its 60-year history, DARPA has made significant investments in 
the creation and advancement of artificial intelligence technologies 
that have produced game-changing capabilities for the Department of 
Defense and beyond. DARPA's AI Next effort is simply a continuing part 
of its historic investment in the exploration and advancement of AI 
technologies.
    Current R&D investment around the world is largely focused on 
second wave AI or machine learning, which is very good in finding 
patterns in voice and imagery and has many commercial applications. The 
difference is, in the United States, DARPA is aggressively pursuing 
programs that will make second wave AI more robust for defense and 
security applications, all while helping realize the third wave of AI, 
or contextual reasoning. DARPA has unique access to the United States' 
world-class science and technology community, comprised of leading 
universities, government labs, and industry partners--this mix cannot 
be found or replicated anywhere else in the world. Marshalling those 
unique resources, the Agency's third wave research efforts will forge 
new theories and methods that will make it possible for machines to 
adapt contextually to changing situations, advancing computers from 
tools to true collaborative partners. Going forward, the agency will be 
fearless about exploring these new technologies and their 
capabilities--DARPA's core function--pushing critical frontiers ahead 
of our nation's adversaries.

    Senator Ernst. Very good. Thank you so much.
    Mr. Michael Brown is the Director of the Defense Innovation 
Unit, DIU, at the U.S. Department of Defense. DIU fields 
leading-edge capability to the military, using commercial 
technologies faster and more cost-effectively than traditional 
acquisition methods. Prior to that, Mr. Brown served as a White 
House Presidential Innovation Fellow at the Defense Department. 
He has also worked as CEO [Chief Executive Officer] of Semantec 
Corporation and as CEO of Quantum Corporation.
    Thank you, Mr. Brown, for joining us today. It's good to 
have you here again. If you would, please go ahead with your 
opening statements.

  STATEMENT OF MICHAEL A. BROWN, DIRECTOR, DEFENSE INNOVATION 
                              UNIT

    Mr. Brown. Thank you, Chairman Ernst, Ranking Member 
Peters, and Members of the Subcommittee. Thank you for inviting 
me here today to discuss DIU's efforts in AI.
    As you said, about 6 months ago, I joined DIU as the 
Director, and, having led a number of technology companies, 
most recently Semantec, I've witnessed how new technology like 
AI can fundamentally redefine how we live and work, and how we 
fight wars.
    Before joining DIU as the Director, as you mentioned, I 
worked as a Fellow, responding to the Secretary of Defense's 
request to understand China's investments in early-stage 
technology firms, many of which were AI-focused, and its 
technology transfer implications for national security.
    As you mentioned in opening remarks, China and Russia have 
already recognized the enormous commercial and military 
potential of AI, and are investing heavily, with aims to become 
dominant. By 2025, China aims to achieve major breakthroughs in 
AI and increase its domestic market to reach $60 billion. To 
achieve this target, the Chinese government leverages civil-
military fusion, where, by law, every commercial AI innovation 
is immediately transferred to the Chinese military. China also 
leverages United States talent and resources by establishing 
research institutes in the United States, investing in AI-
related startups in the United States, recruiting talent in the 
United States, and building academic partnerships.
    Russia, as you mentioned, with Vladimir Putin's comments, 
is similarly focused on building its AI capacity, but is behind 
the United States and China, in terms of overall investment, 
research, and startups.
    In the face of great-power competition, DIU is working 
alongside--with the rest of DOD to maintain our technological 
edge, not only in AI, but other dual-use technologies, as well. 
Accessing mature AI-driven technologies from the commercial 
sector is an essential component of the Defense Department's 
Artificial Intelligence Strategy and a paradigm shift from 
defense industrial base to a national security innovation base 
prescribed by the National Defense Strategy.
    DIU's AI portfolio focuses on understanding, tracking, and 
vetting commercial companies' abilities to solve high-impact 
problems identified by our military leadership. AI projects 
today include work with the Air Force, Army, Navy, and 
components, as well as Joint Chiefs of Staff.
    As a foundational technology, the DIU AI portfolio 
specifically prioritizes projects that address three major 
impact areas where AI has proven to excel commercially. Here 
are three examples:
    First, computer vision. Adding automation to object 
recognition and infrastructure assessment, DIU is prototyping 
computer-vision algorithms in humanitarian assistance and 
disaster recovery use cases.
    Second, large dataset analytics and predictions, making 
sense of massive datasets and patterns more efficiently and 
cost-effectively than human analysts. For example, DIU is 
prototyping predictive maintenance applications for Air Force 
and Army platforms, with the potential to save the Department 
billions of dollars.
    Third, strategic reasoning, mapping probabilistic chains of 
events and developing alternative strategies to inform top-down 
planning in environments characterized by uncertainty, missing 
information, and speculation. DIU is prototyping an application 
that leverages AI to provide insights to high-level strategic 
questions.
    With these projects, DIU engages across the Department on 
AI and makes its commercial knowledge and relationships with 
potential vendors available to any of the services, service 
labs, and components. We already have in place a strategic 
partnership with JAIC, which we've agreed upon with General 
Shanahan. Simply stated, DIU will prototype commercially 
successful AI applications and measure their relevance to 
mission imperatives. If successful, we transition those to JAIC 
so they can be scaled and integrated into their national 
mission initiatives. We look forward to working closely 
together with JAIC.
    DIU also works with the Defense Innovation Board and will 
work with the newly established Congressional National Security 
Commission on AI to leverage the best practices and learnings 
from the commercial software industry executives who 
participate on that board.
    Cultural divides and ethical differences are often blamed 
for the lack of closer cooperation between DOD and Silicon 
Valley, but, more often than not, the true deterrent is 
misaligned economics. Enabling DOD to be a better customer for 
early-stage companies will not only help DOD acquire the best 
commercial technology faster and cheaper, but will also provide 
access to the ideas of sought-after AI talent that DOD may not 
be able to attract. The more we collaborate with the private 
sector on mutually-beneficial projects, the more opportunities 
we'll have to engage in an open dialogue about the applications 
and principles for the use of AI.
    DIU plans to continue its focus on AI as a key technology 
portfolio, solving DOD problems with commercial AI solutions to 
bring the Department new capabilities and encourage 
nontraditional technology firms to work with DOD as part of the 
national security innovation base, will be a priority.
    Thank you.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Brown follows:]

                  Prepared Statement by Michael Brown
                              introduction
    Chairman Ernst, Ranking Member Peters, and distinguished Members of 
the Subcommittee on Emerging Technologies and Threats, thank you for 
inviting me to appear before you today to discuss the Defense 
Innovation Unit (DIU) and our efforts in artificial intelligence (AI) 
alongside my colleagues at the Defense Advanced Research Projects 
Agency (DARPA) and the newly formed Joint Artificial Intelligence 
Center (JAIC).
    AI is fundamentally redefining how we live, work, and fight wars. 
Within the Department of Defense (DOD), AI has the potential to 
transform how the Department operates at all levels, from business to 
the battlefield. In the face of competition from China and Russia, DOD 
aims to maintain its technological edge through establishing a more 
decentralized, experimental procurement approach: cultivating a leading 
AI workforce, engaging academic, commercial, and international allies 
and partners, and developing ethical and lawful guidelines for AI use.

    China and Russia have recognized the enormous commercial and 
military potential of AI and are investing heavily to become dominant 
in the field. In its 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020) and subsequent 
industrial plans, the Chinese Government has outlined a comprehensive, 
whole-of-government strategy to become the global leader in AI. \2\ In 
July 2017, the State Council released the Next-Generation Artificial 
Intelligence Development Plan that laid out a 2020 target for Chinese 
AI technology and applications to match international developments and 
create a $22.3 billion (Renminbi [RMB] 150 billion) \3\ domestic 
market. \4\ By 2025, China will aim to achieve major breakthroughs in 
AI and increase its domestic market to reach $59.6 billion (RMB 400 
billion). \5\ To achieve these targets, China's National Development 
and Reform Commission (China's industrial policy-making agency) funded 
the creation of a national AI laboratory, and Chinese local governments 
have pledged more than than $7 billion in AI funding. \6\ In addition, 
Chinese firms and the Chinese Government are leveraging United States 
talent and ecosystems through the establishment of research institutes 
in the United States, investment in U.S. AI-related startups and firms, 
recruitment of U.S.-based talent, and commercial and academic 
partnerships. \7\ Russia is similarly focused on building its AI 
capacity but is behind the United States and China in terms of overall 
AI investment, research, and startups. \8\

    To increase intergovernmental coordination, DIU will engage with 
DARPA and JAIC, among other DOD entities focused on AI, as well as make 
its commercial knowledge and relationships with potential vendors 
available to any of the Services and Service Labs. For example, DIU 
will be working with the Services and Defense Agencies as DOD customers 
for the projects it undertakes. AI projects today include work with the 
Air Force, Army, Navy, and components as well as the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff. DIU also works with the Defense Innovation Board and the newly 
established Congressional Commission on AI to leverage the best 
practices and learnings from the commercial software industry 
executives who participate on the Board.
    In particular, we anticipate a close partnership with JAIC, the 
outlines of which DIU has already agreed upon with Lieutenant General 
Jack Shanahan. As JAIC matures, we anticipate that DIU will be at the 
leading edge of the Department's National Mission Initiatives (NMIs), 
proving that commercial technology can be applied to critical national 
security challenges via accelerated prototypes that lay the groundwork 
for future scaling through JAIC. DIU looks to bring in key elements of 
AI development pursued by the commercial sector, which relies heavily 
on continuous feedback loops, vigorous experimentation using data, and 
iterative development, all to achieve the measurable outcome, mission 
impact.
  reinvigorating outreach to commercial technology companies: defense 
                            innovation unit
    DIU is focused on accelerating commercial technology into the hands 
of men and women in uniform. Its staff is comprised of Active Duty 
military from every service, civilians, and individuals with extensive 
private sector experience and deep ties into venture capital and 
startup communities. DIU partners with the Services, Combatant 
Commands, and component organizations to seek out and rapidly prototype 
advanced commercial solutions--spanning AI, autonomy, cyber, human 
systems, and space--to address military challenges ranging from the 
tactical level to the defense enterprise. Within OUSD(R&E) and the 
broader DOD, DIU is unique in its focus on developing and fielding 
commercial hardware, software, and methodologies within an 
approximately 24-month timeframe.
    Accessing R&D and mature AI-driven technologies advanced by the 
commercial sector is an essential component of the strategic approach 
defined by the 2018 Department of Defense Artificial Intelligence 
Strategy and the paradigm shift from ``defense industrial base'' to 
``national security innovation base'' prescribed by the 2018 National 
Defense Strategy. Senior leaders in the Department understand that DOD 
no longer holds a monopoly on emerging technologies like AI that will 
sway strategic, deterrent, and battlefield advantage in future wars. 
\10\ U.S. businesses began outspending the Federal Government in R&D in 
the 1980s, and now, industry-funded R&D represents approximately 67 
percent of total U.S. investments. \11\

``Future Foundry: A New Strategic Approach to Military-Technical 
Advantage,'' (Center for a New American Security, December 2016).
    \11\ 11 DIU exists, in part, in response to the growing disparity 
between federal and commercial R&D, leading to a global technology 
landscape in which commercial companies are leading the development of 
some of the world's most advanced technologies: ``In 1960, the United 
States accounted for 69 percent of global R&D, with U.S. defense-
related R&D alone accounting for more than one-third of global R&D. The 
Federal Government funded approximately twice as much R&D as U.S. 
business. However, from 1960 to 2016, the U.S. share of global R&D fell 
to 28 percent, and the Federal Government's share of total U.S. R&D 
fell from 65 percent to 24 percent, while business's share more than 
doubled from 33 percent to 67 percent. As a result of these global, 
national, and federal trends, federal defense R&D's share of total 
global R&D fell to 3.7 percent in 2016.'' Moshe Schwartz and Heidi M.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Moreover, venture capital funding for AI-related companies reached 
record highs in 2018, increasing 72 percent from 2017 totaling $9.3 
billion. \12\ With offices in Silicon Valley, Boston, Austin, and 
Washington, D.C., DIU is embedded in the core innovation ecosystems 
where these deals are taking place, AI startups are thriving, and top 
tech companies and universities are conducting groundbreaking research. 
\13\ DIU's location not only facilitates deeper ties with leading edge 
companies but allows the Department to establish a closer relationship 
with venture firms as they scout the horizon for their next big bets 
and take into consideration clear demand signals from DOD.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    DIU seeks to lower barriers to entry into the defense market by 
more closely matching commercial terms and contracting speeds via its 
Commercial Solutions Opening (CSO) solicitation process, which 
leverages Other Transaction (OT) authority. Traditional acquisition 
pathways overburden technology companies operating with little or no 
prior DOD contracting experience and runways that are often shorter 
than the typical time to award a contract under the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation. Shaping the DOD into a better customer through new 
processes allows the Department to acquire the best commercial 
technology faster and cheaper than the traditional system. Furthermore, 
new acquisition pathways create more opportunities for national 
security service, making DOD a more competitive employer of AI and 
other sought-after tech talent through commercial contracts.
    While cultural divides and ethical differences are often blamed for 
the lack of closer cooperation between DOD and Silicon Valley, more 
often than not, the true deterrent is misaligned economics. \14\ Since 
DIU opened its first competitive solicitation using the CSO process in 
June 2016, there has been no shortage of top-performing companies 
interested in working alongside our DOD partners to solve some of the 
toughest military challenges. DIU has awarded contracts to 103 of these 
companies, 43 of which are first-time, non-traditional DOD contractors.

                      diu's ai strategy & projects
    Commercial AI companies are active across a wide range of sectors 
and the opportunities for dual-use applications within DOD are vast. 
The DIU AI portfolio focuses on understanding, tracking, and vetting 
these commercial companies' ability to solve high-impact problems 
identified by our military leadership and DOD partners. The portfolio 
team combines depth of commercial AI, machine learning, and data 
science experience from the commercial sector with military operators. 
As a foundational technology, AI-driven solutions appear across a 
number of DIU projects administered by other portfolio teams, however, 
the AI portfolio specifically prioritizes projects that address three 
major impact areas where AI is proven to excel:

    1.  Computer vision: AI and machine learning adds automation to 
object recognition and infrastructure assessment; for example, DIU is 
prototyping computer vision algorithms in humanitarian assistance and 
disaster recovery scenarios.

    2.  Large dataset analytics and predictions: AI and machine 
learning can help make sense of massive datasets and patterns more 
efficiently and cost-effectively than human analysts; for example, DIU 
is prototyping predictive maintenance applications for Air Force and 
Army platforms.

    3.  Strategic reasoning: AI and machine learning has the capacity 
to inform top-down planning in environments characterized by 
uncertainty, missing information, and speculation; for example, DIU is 
prototyping an application that leverages AI to reason about high-level 
strategic questions, map probabilistic chains of events, and develop 
alternative strategies.

    Furthermore, DIU has a strategic partnership with JAIC wherein 
DIU's prototype AI applications ``pull'' on commercial capabilities, 
prove and measure their applicability to mission imperatives, and (if 
successful) are transitioned to JAIC to be scaled and integrated into 
their NMI. In previous testimony before the House Armed Services 
Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, Dr. Lisa Porter, 
Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, 
discussed the need to rigorously assess AI performance against 
quantitative metrics tied to specific mission needs. \16\ DIU's 
partnership with JAIC aims to institutionalize the rigor Dr. Porter 
spoke of----the AI portfolio's prototype projects are designed to drive 
metrics, establish benchmarks, and contribute infrastructure towards a 
common foundation as described by the 2018 Department of Defense 
Artificial Intelligence Strategy. \17\

    Following are three specific use cases and projects which employ AI 
technology:
Applying Computer Vision to Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief
    In 2018, DIU hosted the xView Challenge to test computer vision and 
the use of algorithms to automatically identify objects from images. 
The competition attracted more than 4,000 submissions from 100 
participants from around the world including companies, universities, 
and individuals. The top performing algorithms were 300 percent more 
accurate than the government produced baseline, which helps advance 
computer vision proficiency across four core elements of overhead 
imagery analysis. The winning algorithm was then used to automate post-
disaster assessments in the wake of Hurricane Florence, assisting 
emergency personnel to quickly identify flooded areas and impassable 
roads. This use of AI holds the potential to automate post-disaster 
assessments and accelerate search and rescue efforts on a global scale.
Scaling Predictive Maintenance to Improve Readiness and Cut Costs
    DIU's predictive maintenance prototype project provides a specific 
example of the synergy that we plan to foster between OUSD(R&E) and 
JAIC. DIU identified a leading commercial airline industry supplier of 
predictive maintenance solutions and launched a six-month prototype for 
E-3 Sentry aircraft maintenance. The prototype began with testing 
predictions at the part and sub-part level against historical actuals 
to establish the robustness of the AI and its relevance to operational 
decision-making. This methodology effectively assesses the accuracy of 
the AI predictions, how much they matter, and in which areas the most 
impact can be expected (as defined by cost and/or platform 
availability). Early results of Air Force applications indicate a 
potential 28 percent decrease in unscheduled maintenance on the E-3 
across six sub-systems and more than 32 percent reduction on the C-5 
across ten sub-systems. DIU is partnering with JAIC to scale this 
solution across multiple aircraft platforms, as well as ground vehicles 
beginning with DIU's complementary predictive maintenance project 
focusing on the Army's Bradley Fighting Vehicle. This is one of DIU's 
highest priority projects for fiscal year 2019 given its enormous 
potential for impact on readiness and reducing costs.
Automating Cyber Vulnerability Detection & Remediation
    DOD's current vulnerability discovery process for weapons systems 
software lacks the capability to scale because it relies on time and 
labor-intensive human search and analysis. According to an October 2018 
GAO report, $1.66 trillion of weapon system development is at risk due 
to the scale of unmitigated cyber vulnerabilities. \18\ One of the 
tools to address these vulnerabilities is DIU's Project VOLTRON, which 
is an active prototype project that has demonstrated artificially 
intelligent detection of previously unknown vulnerabilities in 
classified weapons systems. The project seeks to demonstrate autonomous 
exploitation and patching; development of an application programming 
interface (API) for extensibility; and integration into DOD software 
development environments. This would give the DOD an end-to-end 
capability that goes from writing software free of vulnerabilities to 
remediating vulnerabilities in compiled mission software for which 
source code is not available. The products from Project VOLTRON help 
make DOD owned systems more resilient to cyber attacks and inform 
program offices of configuration errors faster and with less errors 
than humans. An initial capability demonstration of the commercial 
technologies leveraged by VOLTRON yielded previously undiscovered bugs 
within the first few minutes of testing against representative aircraft 
software provided by a defense contractor. In addition, previously 
unknown vulnerabilities have already been discovered in currently 
fielded aircraft systems. Integration into software development 
pipelines will ensure that most vulnerabilities can be found and 
remediated before future systems go into production and/or deployment.

Tremendous Opportunity for DOD/Commercial Collaboration
    Commercial industry is breaking ground on AI applications 
supporting a wide range of business areas and there is a tremendous 
opportunity to re-establish and grow the ties between the user 
communities in DOD, commercial entrepreneurs, and partners in 
universities and labs dedicated to performing the basic research that 
provides a foundation for future advances. While DIU has found the vast 
majority of high-tech companies focused on AI to be willing and 
enthusiastic partners, there is work yet to be done to provide and 
encourage an open dialogue with the private sector and researchers 
about applications and principles of use for this powerful tool. DIU 
will continue to solve DOD problems with commercial AI solutions to 
bring the Department new capabilities and encourage non-traditional 
technology firms to work with DOD to grow the national security 
innovation base.

    Senator Ernst. Thank you very much, Mr. Brown.
    Last, certainly not least, we have Lieutenant General John 
N.T. ``Jack'' Shanahan. General Shanahan is the Director, Joint 
Artificial Intelligence Center, Office of the Department of 
Defense Chief Information Officer (CIO) at the Pentagon. 
General Shanahan is responsible for accelerating the delivery 
of AI-enabled capabilities, scaling the departmentwide impact 
of AI, and synchronizing AI activities to expand joint force 
advantages.
    General, please go ahead.

    STATEMENT LIEUTENANT GENERAL JOHN N.T. SHANAHAN, USAF, 
 DIRECTOR, JOINT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER, OFFICE OF THE 
        DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER

    General Shanahan. Good afternoon, Madam Chairwoman, Ranking 
Member, distinguished Members of the Subcommittee. Thank you 
for the opportunity to testify before the Subcommittee today on 
the Department's artificial intelligence committees.
    I'm honored to serve as the first Director of DOD's Joint 
AI Center, or the JAIC. I've been in this position for just 
over 2 months. Previously, I served in the Under Secretary of 
Defense for Intelligence, where, for 2 years, I was the 
Director of the Algorithmic Warfare Cross-functional Team, also 
known as Project Maven.
    Artificial intelligence, or AI, is rapidly changing an 
ever-expanding range of businesses and industries. It offers 
the opportunity to transform every corner of the Department 
from multidomain operations at the edge to back-office business 
functions. As described in the 2019 National Defense Strategy, 
or NDS, it is also poised to change the character of warfare. 
Thoughtful, responsible, and human-centered adoption of AI in 
the DOD will strengthen our national security and transform the 
speed and agility of our operations.
    Last June, then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Shanahan 
directed the DOD Chief Information Officer, Mr. Dana Deasy, to 
establish the Joint AI Center to accelerate the delivery and 
adoption of AI-enabled capabilities, scale the departmentwide 
impact of AI, and synchronize the Department's AI activities. 
In parallel, DOD submitted its first AI Strategy to the 
Congress as an annex to the NDS. Last month, the Department 
released an unclassified summary of DOD's AI Strategy, doing so 
on the heels of the President's signature of the executive 
order on AI. The JAIC's missions and functions nest well under 
the principles and objectives outlined in the AI executive 
order.
    JAIC's formation also dovetails section 238 of the fiscal 
year 2019 NDAA. Additionally, JAIC will benefit from, and help 
bring to fruition, recommendations of the new National Security 
Commission (NSC) on AI. I was privileged to talk with the 
members of the Commission yesterday, when they met for the 
first time. I know Senator Heinrich was also there.
    The JAIC is the focal point of the DOD AI Strategy and was 
established to provide a common vision, mission, and focus to 
drive departmentwide AI capability delivery. I want to 
highlight three primary themes for our approach:
    First, delivering AI-enabled capabilities at speed. JAIC is 
collaborating with teams across DOD to identify, prioritize, 
and select mission needs, and then execute a series of cross-
functional use cases to demonstrate value and spur momentum. We 
need early demonstrable wins to show practical results and the 
art of the possible, followed by scaling across the enterprise. 
Projects fall into two main categories: national mission 
initiatives, or NMIs, and component mission initiatives, or 
CMIs. NMIs are driven and executed by the JAIC as broad, joint, 
crosscutting AI challenges; whereas, CMIs are component-led, 
but are able to make use of JAIC's common tools, libraries, 
best practices, and more.
    Our emphasis on rapid, iterative delivery of AI complements 
the Department's ongoing work at the other end of the AI 
spectrum, in fundamental research and development, as you heard 
from Dr. Highnam. Our first two NMIs are predictive maintenance 
with the Special Operations Command and U.S. Army H-60 
helicopter use case and humanitarian assistance and disaster 
relief, in which we will field AI capabilities in support of 
natural events, such as wildfires and hurricanes. We are also 
getting a headstart on a planned fiscal year 2020 cyberspace 
NMI designed to use AI-enabled capabilities to improve event 
detection, network mapping, and compromised-account 
identification.
    At the same time, we are now in the early problem-framing 
stage for another proposed NMI in fiscal year 2020 that will be 
more oriented on the NDS, National Defense Strategy, in 
operations against peer competitors. We are also in initial 
discussions with the Military Services, components, and 
combatant commands on the applicability of AI to help with 
solutions in areas as diverse as talent management, suicide 
prevention, preventive medicine, and information operations, 
among others.
    The second theme is scale. As I know firsthand from Project 
Maven, scaling AI across the enterprise is hard, but it's also 
the only way we will realize the full benefits of AI in the 
Department. JAIC's early projects serve a dual purpose, to 
deliver new capabilities to end users as well as to 
incrementally develop the common foundation that is essential 
for scaling AI's impact across DOD. We will put this foundation 
in place in a way that aligns with DOD enterprise cloud 
adoption.
    The third theme is talent. We built the initial JAIC team 
with representatives detailed from across each of the services 
and other components. Today, we have 30 people, growing to over 
50 within the next 5 months. We do not receive our permanent 
manpower until fiscal year 2020.
    For the JAIC to succeed, we must attract and cultivate a 
select group of mission-driven, world-class AI talent, to 
include enticing experts from the tech industry to serve with 
us. The success of human-centered AI and human-machine teaming 
within DOD requires growing and sustaining an AI-ready force, 
one that is conversant in the language of AI, willing and able 
to operate with a new kind of speed and agility.
    In closing, the JAIC is now up and running, and we're open 
for business. Thank you for your strong support in driving 
momentum in this critical area. I look forward to continuing to 
work with Congress as we advance the adoption of AI across the 
Department and use the JAIC to accelerate our progress.
    Thank you for the opportunity to testify this afternoon. I 
look forward to your questions.
    [The prepared statement of General Shanahan follows:]

  Prepared Statement by Lieutenant General John ``Jack'' N.T. Shanahan
                              introduction
    Good afternoon Madam Chairwoman, Ranking Member, and distinguished 
Members of the Subcommittee. Thank you for this opportunity to testify 
before the Subcommittee today on the Department's Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) Initiatives.
    I am Lieutenant General Jack Shanahan, the Director of the Joint 
Artificial Intelligence Center or JAIC. I have been in my current 
position for a little over two months. Previously, I served in the 
Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence as the Director of the 
Algorithmic Warfare Cross-Functional Team or Project Maven, the 
Department's pathfinder project to integrate AI capabilities to 
augment, accelerate, and automate collection from a variety of manned 
and unmanned intelligence platforms and sensors.
    AI is rapidly changing an ever-expanding range of business and 
industry. As described in the 2018 National Defense Strategy (NDS), AI 
is also poised to change the character of warfare. Structurally, we 
know AI has the potential to be an enabling layer across nearly 
everything--meaning countless applications in industry and everyday 
life, while offering the opportunity to positively transform every 
corner of the Department. We envision innovative concepts that change 
the way we plan and fight, including improvements in the way we 
perceive our environment, maintain our equipment, train our men and 
women, defend our networks, operate our back offices, provide 
humanitarian aid and respond to disasters; and more. By harnessing the 
power of AI in defense, we will better support and protect American 
servicemembers, safeguard our citizens, defend our allies, and improve 
the effectiveness, affordability, and speed of our operations.
    Other nations, particularly strategic competitors such as China and 
Russia, are making significant investments in AI for military purposes. 
These investments threaten to erode our technological and operational 
advantages and destabilize the free and open international order. The 
Department of Defense, together with our allies and partners, must 
adopt AI to maintain its strategic position, prevail on future 
battlefields, and safeguard this order.
    Per the NDS, the Department will accelerate the delivery and 
adoption of AI to expand our military advantages and create a force fit 
for our time. AI will enhance operational effectiveness, improve 
readiness, and increase efficiency in the general business practices of 
the Department. We will make a concerted effort to move AI technologies 
in a direction that improves our odds of long-term security, peace, and 
stability through vigorous dialogue and multilateral cooperation on the 
ethical, safe, and lawful use of AI for national security and 
establishing new norms for responsible behavior, consistent with the 
law. The Department's AI transformation will ensure that we maintain 
the ability to execute our vital mission of protecting the security of 
our nation, deterring war, and preserving peace.
                         establishment of jaic
    Last June, then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan 
directed Mr. Dana Deasy, the Department's Chief Information Officer, to 
establish the Joint AI Center. This new organization is tasked to 
accelerate the delivery of AI-enabled capabilities, scale the 
Department-wide impact of AI, and synchronize the Department's AI 
activities. In parallel, the Department submitted its first AI Strategy 
to Congress, an annex to the NDS that captures the integrated set of 
decisions we are making now to harness AI to advance our security and 
prosperity. Last month, the Department released an unclassified summary 
of the classified DOD AI strategy, in support of the President's 
Executive Order on AI (Maintaining American Leadership in Artificial 
Intelligence) that calls for greater AI investment, harmonization of 
standards, and training and workforce development initiatives. The 
JAIC's missions and functions nest well under the principles and 
objectives outlined in the AI Executive Order.
    The founding of JAIC supports implementation of section 238 of the 
fiscal year 2019 National Defense Authorization Act, this provision 
directed a joint approach to coordinate the efforts of the Department 
to develop, mature, and transition AI technologies into operational 
use. The Department views the requirements of section 238 as a 
strategic opportunity to improve its posture for AI. In fact, we used 
elements from the language in section 238 to help frame the JAIC's 
roles, missions, and functions. In December 2018, JAIC commissioned a 
team from the RAND Corporation to support our analysis. The RAND team 
built its analytical framework, completed initial DOD-wide data 
collection, and is currently building interview protocols and contact 
lists for engaging with industry.
    As part of this, I will now touch on how we are partnering with the 
Under Secretary of Defense (USD) Research & Engineering (R&E), the role 
of the Military Services, the Department's initial focus areas for AI 
delivery, and how JAIC is supporting whole-of-government efforts in AI.
    As the focal point of the DOD AI Strategy, the JAIC was established 
to provide a common vision, mission, and focus to drive Department-wide 
AI capability delivery. JAIC will operate across the full AI delivery 
lifecycle, emphasizing near-term prototyping, execution, and 
operational adoption to meet current needs. JAIC's work will complement 
the AI efforts of USD(R&E), which are focused on foundational research, 
longer-term technology creation, and innovative concepts. Both JAIC and 
USD(R&E) will need to collaborate effectively and succeed individually 
for the DOD to implement its ambitious AI strategy.
    The JAIC communicates a consistent message about transforming DOD 
through AI. This refers to the transformation that happens when you 
field technology on operationally-relevant timelines, enable frontline 
men and women to experiment with it based on their own creativity, and 
ultimately generate new ways of working that solve our most critical 
challenges and enhance our military strength. As we move to rapidly 
incorporate AI, those men and women in America's military will remain 
our enduring source of strength. We will use AI-enabled information, 
tools, and systems to empower and augment, not replace, those who 
serve.
    To derive maximum value from AI application throughout the 
Department, JAIC will operate across an end-to-end lifecycle of problem 
identification, prototyping, integration, scaling, transition, and 
sustainment. Emphasizing commerciality to the maximum extent 
practicable, JAIC will partner with the Services and other components 
across the Joint Force to systematically identify, prioritize, and 
select new AI mission initiatives. Then JAIC will stand up cross-
functional teams that will rapidly execute a sequence of use cases that 
demonstrate value and spur momentum. We need early, demonstrable wins 
that show practical results and the art of the possible. Then, we must 
scale these capabilities across the enterprise. To do this, JAIC is 
engaging with leading commercial and academic partners for prototypes, 
and employing standardized processes with respect to areas such as data 
management, testing and evaluation, assessment of delivered 
capabilities, and program protection and cybersecurity. Our approach 
has been directly informed by the Department's AI pathfinder activity, 
Project Maven, which successfully identified and is beginning to 
address key challenges with integrating AI into operations. This 
program put in place an initial set of data, tools, and infrastructure 
for AI delivery, as well as initial templates for contracting and 
acquisition, testing and evaluation, operational assessment, and 
program protection.
    JAIC's early projects serve a dual purpose: to deliver new AI-
enabled capabilities to end users, and to help incrementally develop a 
common foundation that is essential for scaling AI's impact across DOD. 
This foundation includes shared data, reusable tools, frameworks, 
libraries, and standards, and AI cloud and edge services. JAIC will 
work with teams throughout the Department to ensure that they can 
leverage this foundation to accelerate their progress in a manner that 
aligns with DOD enterprise cloud adoption. Our enterprise approach for 
AI and enterprise cloud adoption as outlined in the DOD-wide Cloud 
Strategy are mutually reinforcing, mutually dependent undertakings. 
Finally, JAIC will provide ongoing support to the efforts of the 
Services and other organizations to ensure continuous improvement, 
assessment, and sustainment of AI systems and solutions across the 
enterprise.
    The AI capability delivery efforts that will go through this 
lifecycle will fall into two categories: National Mission Initiatives 
(NMI) and Component Mission Initiatives (CMI). As outlined in the DOD 
AI Strategy, a NMI is a pressing operational or business reform joint 
challenge, typically identified from the National Defense Strategy's 
key operational problems or nominated by a mission owner, and requiring 
multi-service innovation, coordination, and the parallel introduction 
of new technology and new operating concepts. NMIs are typically driven 
by JAIC and are executed by cross-functional teams that comprise both 
JAIC personnel as well as subject matter specialists from across the 
Department on a rotational basis. Execution of these projects will be 
essential for putting in place our initial common foundation.
    The second project category is a Component Mission Initiative 
(CMI), which is a component-level challenge that can be solved through 
AI. JAIC will work closely with individual components on CMIs to help 
identify, shape, and accelerate their Component-specific AI deployments 
through funding support; usage of common foundational tools, libraries, 
cloud infrastructure; application of best practices; partnerships with 
industry and academia; and so on. The Component will be responsible for 
identifying and implementing the organizational structure required to 
accomplish its project in coordination and partnership with the JAIC.
    We will form teams to work with the Services, Components, and 
Combatant Commands on potential CMIs. Based on initial conversations 
with all of these stakeholders, I fully expect that we will see rapid 
growth in the number of CMIs in Fiscal Year 2020. We are in early 
discussions with the Services, Components, and Combatant Commands on 
the applicability of AI to help with solutions in areas as diverse as 
talent management, suicide prevention, preventive medicine, 
installation and force protection, information operations, operational 
war planning, and modeling and simulation. Additionally, we intend to 
identify smart automation initiatives that could provide near-term 
dividends in terms of increased effectiveness and efficiency for back-
office functions.
    All of the Services are increasing their levels of investment in 
AI-related capabilities in near term. The JAIC is already forming 
strong partnerships with the Services and key Components. For example, 
the Army established a new AI Task Force that is working closely with 
the JAIC on predictive maintenance. We are actively engaged in an 
effort to apply data-driven insights to equipment availability at U.S. 
Special Operations Command and in the U.S. Air Force in partnership 
with Defense Innovation Unit (DIU). We are partnering with U.S. Cyber 
Command and the National Security Agency to shape a new cyberspace-
related mission initiative. These early efforts will better define how 
we make use of common approaches to data, tools, libraries, 
architectures, development approaches, and more.
    JAIC's focus on near-term AI implementation and adoption 
complements efforts within the USD (R&E). Organizations such as the 
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) are focused on the 
future or next wave of AI research and longer-term technology creation. 
When it comes to research for the future versus the ability to apply it 
now at scale, DOD needs the best of both, and they feed one another--
USD(R&E) will feed JAIC with updates on leading-edge AI technologies 
and concepts, and JAIC will provide R&E insights from operational 
fielding, user feedback, and data. There is a distinct and shared 
vision of an enterprise approach promulgated by USD(R&E) and DOD CIO. 
JAIC is already working with DIU, DARPA, and the Strategic Capabilities 
Office to improve integration and enhance unity of effort on current 
and future AI projects.
    Further examples of early NMI's include:

      Perception. Improve the speed, completeness, and accuracy 
of Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) Processing, 
Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED). Project Maven's efforts are 
included here. -Predictive Maintenance (PMx). Provide computational 
tools to decision makers to help them better forecast, diagnose, and 
manage maintenance issues to increase availability, improve operational 
effectiveness, and ensure safety, at reduced cost.

      Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Relief (HA/DR). Reduce 
the time associated with search and discovery, resource allocation 
decisions, and executing rescue and relief operations to save lives and 
livelihood during disaster operations.

      Cyber Sensemaking. Detect and deter advanced adversarial 
cyber actors who infiltrate and operate within the DOD Information 
Network (DODIN) to increase DODIN security, safeguard sensitive 
information, and allow warfighters and engineers to focus on strategic 
analysis and response.

    We selected these initiatives to deliver mission impact at speed, 
demonstrate the proof of concept for the JAIC operational model, enable 
rapid learning and iterative process refinement, and build out our 
library of reusable tools while validating our enterprise cloud 
architecture. These efforts will benefit us by growing more AI 
credibility and expertise within the JAIC that will return to the 
Services and Components to help accelerate and sustain their own AI 
projects.
    For the predictive/preventive maintenance NMI, we are starting with 
Army and Army Special Operations helicopters (H-60s). There is 
sufficient data available to train algorithms, there will be defined 
return on investment criteria, and this project helps address the 
Secretary's direction to the Services to improve their maintenance 
readiness rates. We anticipate moving to other airframes and vehicles, 
to include working with DIU to scale the promising results they have 
demonstrated using AI for predictive maintenance on other Air Force and 
Army platforms.
    For the humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR) NMI, we 
are already applying lessons learned and reusable tools from Project 
Maven to field AI capabilities in support of federal responses to 
events such as wildfires and hurricanes--where DOD plays a supporting 
role. One of the most important benefits of this NMI is that it is an 
inspiring, societally-beneficial, life-saving mission that is not only 
whole-of-government but whole-of-society. It brings in interagency, 
state and local governments, non-governmental organizations, allied and 
partner nations, and more. It offers a unique opportunity to combine 
DOD efforts with industry and academia in a new type of public-private 
endeavor to operationalize AI to solve our most challenging problems. 
Doing this at scale to address disasters on an integrated basis creates 
the potential to both save lives and livelihood as well as advance 
common tools, lessons, and partnerships for the benefit of many DOD 
missions.
    We are also in the early problem-framing stage for another 
substantial NMI in Fiscal Year 2020 that will be much more oriented on 
the National Defense Strategy and operations against peer and near-peer 
competitors. At the same time we will be seeking cutting-edge 
technologies within commercial industry and in DOD organizations such 
as DARPA that are ready for operational fielding across the Department.
    While its primary focus is delivery initiatives such as these, JAIC 
has an important role in synchronizing DOD AI activities. This avoids 
duplication and excess cost, fosters sharing of lessons, and 
establishes a new enterprise approach for translating AI into decisions 
and impact at scale across the Joint Force. Under the DOD CIO's 
authorities and as delineated in the JAIC establishment memo, JAIC will 
coordinate all DOD AI-related projects above $15 million annually. This 
does not mean that JAIC will control the execution of these projects or 
the funding for Service-and Component-level AI initiatives. It does 
mean that we will start to ensure, for example, that they begin to 
leverage common tools and libraries, manage data using best practices, 
reflect a common governance framework, adhere to rigorous testing and 
evaluation methodologies, share lessons learned, and comply with 
architectural principles and standards that enable scale. Over time, 
when properly resourced, JAIC will assume a greater role with regard to 
Component AI programs.
    JAIC will be a key resource for whole-of-government efforts in AI, 
particularly as we explore as a nation the opportunities and challenges 
associated not merely with fundamental AI research, but also with 
translating the technology into decisions and impact in operations. To 
underscore our focus on ethics, humanitarian considerations, and both 
short-term and long-term AI safety, JAIC is working closely with the 
Defense Innovation Board (DIB) to foster a broad dialogue and provide 
input into the development of AI principles for defense. We are 
offering our perspective on crucial policy and research and development 
associated with operationalizing AI today in our engagements with the 
important work of the National Security Council Staff and the National 
Science and Technology Council Select Committee on AI. This remains a 
larger Administration priority. On February 11, 2019, President Trump 
signed an executive order launching the American AI Initiative, a whole 
of government strategy for ensuring American leadership in this 
important field. I want to emphasize the importance of our partnerships 
with Congress in all areas, but with a particular focus on AI. The 
establishment of the National Security Commission on Artificial 
Intelligence in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 
2019 is one key example of this partnership, to which JAIC will serve 
as the DOD liaison element.
    The ingredients for JAIC's success include: enterprise cloud 
adoption; world-class AI talent, particularly in areas that are scarce 
within DOD today such as data science and data engineering, machine and 
reinforcement learning, and product management; a workforce that is 
taking steps to become broadly AI-ready; strong partnerships with the 
Services, Combatant Commands, and other key components; a tight two-way 
integration with the critical work of USD(R&E); and energetic, combined 
problem-solving enabled by bonds of trust with AI leaders in industry 
and academia. The final ingredient for success in cultivating and 
sustaining an ``AI Ready'' force for the future is culture: 
specifically, the need to become a more data-centric, computer science-
literate, force conversant in the language of AI, and willing and able 
to operate with a new kind of speed and agility. Finally, an unwavering 
commitment to ethics and principles. These are the table stakes in AI.
    DOD's legacy culture and processes are particularly apparent in the 
challenges we encounter launching what can only be described as a 
startup within the Department of Defense. As we do so, we are 
incorporating lessons learned from other Department activities that 
resembled startups in how they responded to urgent, compelling 
requirements across the Department--such as the Intelligence, 
Surveillance and Reconnaissance Task Force, Joint Improvised Explosive 
Device Defeat Organization, and Project Maven. As we learned with 
Project Maven, there is no substitute for simply embarking on an AI 
project to gain critical hands-on experience, but we also acknowledge 
the importance of implementing more systemic AI education and training 
programs across the entire Department, at all levels. The Defense 
Innovation Board has been particularly helpful in charting a path 
forward in this area.
    All of this requires striking the right balance between top-down 
pressure and bottom-up innovation. Adding funding and people will not 
by themselves spark the necessary level of institutional change, at 
least not until we have a broader and deeper foundation of people--
especially within all of the military Services--who understand how to 
operationalize and accelerate the AI pipeline.
    AI will change the character of warfare, which in turn will drive 
the need for wholesale changes to doctrine, concept development, and 
tactics, techniques, and procedures. There will be a need for much more 
experimentation, at every level and in every domain. New operating 
concepts will depend on a greater understanding of what AI can (and 
cannot) help achieve. We need to accelerate fielding AI capabilities 
across the joint force, and as we do so, we must validate, refine, and 
adapt operating concepts. This includes thinking about entirely new 
concepts centered on human-machine teaming, as well as the cognitive 
consequences of the widespread fielding of AI capabilities.
    The Joint AI Center will play a critical role in transforming the 
Department by delivering capability at speed to address key missions; 
establishing a common foundation for scaling AI's impact across the 
Joint Force; and facilitating AI plans, policies, and standards, 
including those that ensure we lead the world in the development of AI 
solutions that are robust, resilient, ethical, and secure. We will 
attract and cultivate the expertise of a world-class AI team and an AI-
ready workforce.
    The speed and scale of technological change required is daunting. 
However, the Department must embrace it if we are to reap the benefits 
of continued security and prosperity for the future. Our sustained, 
systemic approach accompanies a palpable sense of urgency. Ultimately, 
this needs to extend across our entire department, government, and 
society.
    I look forward to continuing to work with Congress in an ongoing 
dialogue on our progress in AI adoption, and the ways in which JAIC is 
being used to accelerate that progress. Thank you for the opportunity 
to testify this afternoon, and I look forward to your questions.

    Senator Ernst. Absolutely.
    Again, thank you, to our witnesses, for being here today.
    I'll go ahead and start with the questioning here, and 
then, when Senator Peters--oh, here he comes--when he returns--
I'll go ahead and start with my questions, and then, Senator, 
I'll turn it over to you.
    Again, thank you very much. This is a very interesting 
topic, and I think we can learn a lot from the discussion 
today.
    To all of our witnesses here, if you could share, how are 
the AI efforts in R&D coordinated among DARPA, JAIC, and the 
services? General Shanahan, you had mentioned the 
synchronization of AI activities, and you had mentioned R&D. If 
you could all share, how do you synchronize that information? 
How do you share that information? What are the best techniques 
in doing that?
    Dr. Highnam, if we could start with you, please.
    Dr. Highnam. Whenever DARPA starts a research program, 
there's a development of use cases. We seek to understand: If 
we succeed in that program, who cares, who benefits? That means 
that our program managers are out, talking inside the services 
all the time; in fact, across the national defense 
establishment, writ large. There's the natural inbuilt 
connection before we even start, before we even agree to start 
a high-risk activity. That's true whether it's hypersonics or 
quantum or AI. This is normal business.
    Now, in fields like AI technologies, which are software 
tools with a lot of tail to them--sustainment, deployment 
tails--I personally, as an R&D guy, am really happy to now have 
the JAIC sent up as a partner to take on that 6-4 and on, that 
engineering, deployment, sustainment tail, because I expect it 
will make transitions into practice a lot--not simpler, but 
more straightforward. I fully recognize just how much hard work 
General Shanahan and his team are going to have to do to make 
that end of the business happen.
    Senator Ernst. Absolutely. Thank you.
    Mr. Brown. Senator Ernst, the most important area for us to 
collaborate with is JAIC. As I'm sure you recognize, DARPA has 
a different timeframe in mind that we all benefit from, being 
longer term. DIU's timeframe is 24 months or less, so we aim to 
get commercial companies on contract within 60 days, and then a 
prototype fielded within 2 years. In software, we're trying to 
go faster than that, a year to 18 months.
    In coordinating projects, our strategy with JAIC, which I'm 
very pleased to be in partnership with General Shanahan, is, 
we'll go out and look at what's successful commercially, 
including vendors, and then, if we prototype something 
successfully, we're the trial, and we want to scale it. Then we 
start working with JAIC for what's the infrastructure we need 
and how would we make that available to all of the services. 
For example, we're working together now to get a vendor that we 
have worked with on prototype to get a production contract that 
will be with JAIC so any of the services can take advantage of 
that.
    For our project-base work, we also coordinate with the Vice 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. We have a quarterly meeting with 
General Selva, not just on AI, but our other projects, to make 
sure we're doing things that make sense to joint forces. Then 
we have monthly meetings with each of the Assistant Secretaries 
for Acquisition--so Army, Navy, Air Force, Dr. Jette, Dr. 
Roper, Hondo Geurts--to make sure that what we're working on 
makes sense with their priorities. The last thing we want to be 
doing is a lot of independent projects that don't have 
leverage----
    Senator Ernst. Right.
    Mr. Brown.--across the----
    Senator Ernst. Correct.
    Mr. Brown.--Department.
    Senator Ernst. Correct. Thank you.
    General Shanahan. Senator, while the number may vary 
depending on who wrote it, I think, in fiscal year 2018, the 
number was 511 projects that had AI as their primary focus 
across the Department. The question is, Are all those 511 
projects towards a common end, in support of the National 
Defense Strategy? This question of synchronization is essential 
to where we're going in the JAIC, and it comes down to 
governance and oversight. In section 238 of the NDA [Naitonal 
Defense Authorization Act] actually directs governance and 
oversight, for this very reason.
    We have a lot of work to do in this area. I would like to 
start by just getting our arms around all of the projects that 
will come out in fiscal year 2020, to understand the amount of 
funding, what the projects are for, not to threaten somebody's 
budget. That is not the intent of the JAIC. But, we owe it to 
the Department and to the Hill and to the public to be able to 
account for all of those projects and the money that's being 
spent.
    I take that very seriously. We're still in the building 
phase right now for the JAIC, but we are in early discussions 
about what governance looks like for the JAIC and, How do we 
bring all of us together to understand what are the projects 
going towards? A $200,000 research project at University of 
Michigan may be exactly what we need for a long-term insight 
into a particular part of autonomous vehicles. The question is, 
Do we know about it at a central level so that the Secretary 
and the Deputy Secretary of Defense are comfortable about what 
the Department is doing in artificial intelligence?
    We take this very seriously. As Dr. Highnam said, we're 
also in discussions, just between DARPA and us, on, Where is 
that transition from DARPA, ready to field, over to the JAIC? 
We are in early conversations of that. We don't have programs 
identified yet.
    Senator Ernst. Very good. Well, I appreciate that.
    Going back to what Dr. Highnam said is, of course, Who 
cares and who benefits? I think, bottom line, that is a great 
way to put it. If you're not sharing information and going 
through that synchronization, who cares and who benefits? We 
don't really know. I appreciate that very much.
    Thank you. I will step out. Ranking Member will take over 
the meeting.
    Thank you.
    Dr. Highnam. If I may, one go-back on that. In all of our 
research programs, we also seek transition of the technologies 
that come out. We don't just do the research. This is Defense. 
We're pushing it. We seek transition agreements with the end 
users, wherever they may be, in the services or in the IC 
[intelligence community].
    Senator Ernst. Thank you.
    Senator Peters [presiding]. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman.
    I think I want to--I'd like to pick up a little bit, Mr. 
Brown, on--you were discussing the commercial sector and how 
we're reaching out to the commercial sector to be bringing in a 
lot of this technology. Certainly, that's what we're seeing--
probably some of the most exciting advances are happening 
outside of the DOD, in the commercial space, and, because of 
all the applications from the financial industry, to banking to 
insurance to automobiles--I mean, all of that is going to be 
transformed in significant ways from artificial intelligence.
    But, it's important for the DOD to be able to bring that in 
and use it effectively. There are a number of factors that 
usually, I think, stand in the way of that happening, from our 
very cumbersome procurement process, to say the least, that we 
have, that scares companies away from being involved with the 
Federal Government, to a slow and often late budget process 
that we have here. There are enhanced security reviews. I mean, 
there's a long list of challenges. That's what I'd like you to 
elaborate on, as to, What challenges do you envision, as we try 
to adapt some of these commercial applications into military 
use? Then, General Shanahan, if you'd follow up on Mr. Brown's 
comments. Dr. Highnam, too.
    Mr. Brown. So, Senator Peters, you're exactly right. I am 
benefiting from the wisdom of folks who came before me in 
setting up the Defense Innovation Unit, because we largely 
address, by how we were formed, some of those constraints that 
you talked about.
    First, procurement process. We have set up a special 
solicitation process. It's open--anyone can respond--where we 
do not start with a list of detailed requirements assuming we 
know how industry should solve a problem we might have in DOD. 
But, we start with something very simple--sentence or 
paragraph, saying, ``This is the problem we're trying to solve. 
What can you offer us that will help address that?'' That gets 
us away from, again, very detailed requirements to seeing, What 
does the commercial sector offer?
    Then we try and move at commercial speed and commercial 
terms, meaning we don't have onerous requirements for IP 
[intellectual property], and we don't take companies through 
something that is unfamiliar to them. We'd like them to view 
DOD and government as just another vertical as they look at 
other commercial segments they want to pursue. Again, 
commercial terms and speed are important for us there. Because 
our mission is, How do we expand the national security 
innovation base? How do we get more vendors working with us?
    Then, as it relates to the budget process, that's something 
that we are looking at now. How do we ensure that there's a 
transition if we successfully prototype a use case? How can we 
move quickly to get that fielded? We have to use a variety of 
techniques. Some of them you've helped establish, like the 
Rapid Innovation Fund. Fortunately, in the AI sector, that's 
made much more easy with the partnership with JAIC, because now 
we've got infrastructure, folks who can help make this 
available to the rest of the services. We've talked about the 
contract that we're working right now, production contract 
being one we'll be able to draw from.
    As it relates to security, we try and move away from 
classified use cases and translate those to a commercial 
problem. We try and work almost exclusively in an unclassified 
realm. We're conscious of those constraints, and we have ways 
to make it easier for commercial vendors to work with us.
    I think another benefit is being able to work and access 
the talent, the ideas that come from the folks in the 
commercial sector, because we may not be able to track all the 
talent--it's likely we will not be able to--in the AI fields 
within the Department of Defense.
    Senator Peters. All right. Thank you.
    General?
    General Shanahan. Senator, the legislation is clear: 
commerciality, first and foremost. For the 2 years that I 
worked in Project Maven, we took that approach. Now, there are 
always going to be some unique problem sets within the 
Department that require some in-house developments and in-house 
solutions, but we went with commerciality every time. I would 
say I was fortunate, fortunate in the form of a Marine Corps 
colonel who was an operator, an intelligence professional, but 
also a level-3 certified acquisition pro, and he was able to 
work within the confine of the DFAR [Defense Federal 
Acquisition Regulations Supplement]. People are surprised that 
we use the DFAR to that effect. There are additional 
authorities we've been granted. I haven't had to use them yet 
in the JAIC because we're so new in the standup of the process. 
But, there are ways to work the system, thanks to--as Michael 
Brown just said, the existing solutions are already out there 
in commercial industry. As I get further into standing up the 
JAIC, what I'm looking for, as many arrows as possible in the 
quiver of acquisition and contracting, able to pull for a 
different situation on any given day, whether it's an other 
transaction authority, commercial service, or just using 
straight-up DFAR. But, it's not easy to do it, but there are 
ways to work within the system, and we do put commerciality at 
the beginning of every project.
    Senator Peters. You say that it's not easy, but there are 
ways. You believe that you have the authorities that you need, 
at least at this moment? Or is there more that this committee--
--
    General Shanahan. I do believe, at this moment, we have the 
authorities we need.
    Senator Peters. Okay.
    General Shanahan. I reserve the right, 1 year into this, to 
come back and make a different case.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Peters. Yeah. Duly noted, General.
    Dr. Highnam, did you have anything to add?
    Dr. Highnam. Yes. From the research aspect, looking at our 
investments in fiscal year 2018, about 50 percent of our AI 
research investments were industry, about 14 percent were small 
business. We have a very large coverage of picking up and 
driving the development of the best ideas. About one-third went 
to universities. Those are the sources.
    For us, as we look ahead to technologies coming onboard, 
maturing them, and, to the examples they gave earlier, reducing 
the brittleness and just catering towards the engineering front 
needed for large-scale military deployments, we're addressing 
rigor, making sure they work, robustness. Second-wave 
technology is applied aggressively to defense applications. 
Then creating and proving out the third wave of technologies--
of AI technologies--again, creating them not from whole cloth, 
but from working with the companies and working with the 
schools to do that.
    Senator Peters. Great.
    Thank you.
    Senator Shaheen.
    Senator Shaheen. Thank you all very much. I'm sorry I 
missed your testimony earlier.
    In 2017, China laid out plans to become the leader in AI by 
2030. What's our strategy to make sure, (a) that doesn't 
happen, and (b) that we are the leader, as opposed to China?
    Mr. Brown. I'll take a crack at that. This is obviously 
much broader than a Department of Defense strategy. I think we 
know well how to win a tech race, because we did it quite 
effectively the last time we were involved in one with the 
Soviets in the Cold War and afterwards. It starts with, What 
are doing to invest in ourselves? All the breakthroughs that 
Silicon Valley is benefiting from, even today in our economy, 
as we look at some of these software IPOs [initial public 
offerings]--Uber, Lyft, AirBNB--have come from federally funded 
research. I credit DARPA and the other parts of the Federal 
Government that create those breakthroughs--Internet, GPS 
[global positioning system], miniaturized electronics, et 
cetera. I think it starts with what we do in federally funded 
research, education. What we did to focus on engineering and 
science after Sputnik, need to do that again. Then the national 
purpose. What we have now with the executive order, how do we 
build on that to create a common purpose about this being 
important? My concern would be that--How many Americans know 
about the national order on artificial intelligence, and how 
many young people are we reaching to inspire that this needs to 
be their mission? Because this technology race, especially on 
AI, is going to be multigenerational. It's not going to be 
lasting one administration, or two. We've got to get the 
national purpose behind this to support, then, what we can do 
to leverage that in the Defense Department.
    Senator Shaheen. Well, that raises the next question, which 
is, Are we doing that?
    Mr. Brown. Well, I think you could always say we could be 
doing more.
    Senator Shaheen. Okay. What more should----
    Mr. Brown. There's no----
    Senator Shaheen.--we be doing?
    Mr. Brown. There's no time to waste in this race with 
China. They have----
    Senator Shaheen. So, what----
    Mr. Brown.--some advantages, in terms of, today, probably 
more patents that they've--there's more startup activity, in 
terms of dollars invested. But, the U.S. still has a lot of 
critical advantages, in terms of our education system, what 
we're doing to actually pioneer things, in terms of hardware 
technology to advance AI, the tensor processing units, et 
cetera, the activities like DARPA is working on, with very 
long-term research in mind. I feel like the U.S. still has a 
lead there. We've just got to take more advantage of that. What 
makes us special in this race?
    Senator Shaheen. How concerned are we that, not only is 
China making this commitment, but that they're stealing our 
intellectual property, which includes AI, and that we have not 
figured out how to adequately respond to that, I would say? You 
all may not agree with that, but that's certainly my view. I 
don't know who would like to answer that? General Shanahan?
    General Shanahan. Yes, Senator. To just carry on to what 
Mr. Brown was talking about earlier, it--this is not just a DOD 
question--whole of DOD--it's not just whole of government, it's 
whole of society, it's multigeneration to be able to build. If 
I look at bringing in talent--AI talent into the JAIC, I can 
ask the services to, ``Give me your best AI talent.'' There's 
just not enough to go around. It will take decades to build 
this. This is, one, for the executive order on AI. It's a 
start, but there has to be an implementation plan, which I know 
is coming. But, also, the National Security Commission on AI 
will lay out some of these very factors about, How do we do 
this as a society, everything from grade-school education to 
military courses bringing in concepts of coding all the way 
from the very beginning?
    Now, to your other point, Senator, about intellectual 
property theft, every one of us has a concern about that. It's 
been taken much more seriously in the past 2 years than I would 
have said 5 years ago, beginning to understand the scope of the 
problem. Just using Huawei as an example, having a whole-of-
government approach to convince people not to use that 
technology, because it has an entry point into places in China. 
This is something we're working very hard at protecting our own 
systems, protecting our data. Without getting into any details 
in the project I worked on the Under Secretary of Defense for 
Intelligence Project Maven, but also as we stand up the JAIC, 
is protecting our data, doing everything we can to make sure 
somebody doesn't understand what that data is, how we built our 
algorithms. There is so much more than this. But, I believe the 
sounding board of what China is doing, just within the past 2 
years, is now making a difference. Much more to do, but we are 
taking a different approach than we were in the past.
    Senator Shaheen. Well, thank you. I appreciate that.
    I would argue that, as we look at the education system, 
that one of the things we should recognize is the importance of 
immigration to that, and that, as we look back over the last 30 
or 40 years, that one of the things that has been so important 
to our system of higher education are those people from around 
the world, the best and the brightest. When we have a system 
that says, ``We don't want you to come here to college, and we 
want you to go home as soon as you're done,'' that's not in our 
interest. I would argue that that needs to be part of our 
strategy, as well.
    Thank you.
    Senator Ernst [presiding]. Thank you, Senator Shaheen.
    Senator Heinrich.
    Senator Heinrich. I want to start by thanking our Chair and 
Ranking Member for hosting this hearing. This is an incredibly 
important topic, and one which we all need to be, educating our 
peers about, because, as our guests today know, this is going 
to be a bigger and bigger piece of what we focus on in the next 
few years.
    I'm really pleased to announce that this week we are 
officially launching the Artificial Intelligence Caucus in the 
U.S. Senate. Along with Senators Portman and Schatz, Gardner, 
and our Chair and Ranking Member, we're looking forward to 
trying to work together to strike that right balance in 
developing the technology and the policy so that academia or 
labs, private industry, and Federal entities like the ones we 
have testifying here today, can harness this to the benefit of 
the American people.
    AI is, as you said, really going to impact every sector of 
our economy, our society, not just the Department of Defense. I 
want to start with Lieutenant General Shanahan and thank you 
for your participation yesterday with the AI Commission. It's 
my understanding that the services and other components in the 
Pentagon right now have been directed to coordinate with the 
JAIC, with the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, regarding 
any AI initiatives that cost more than 15 million annually. Is 
that coordination happening?
    General Shanahan. Senator, it's not fully in place yet. It 
is----
    Senator Heinrich. Okay.
    General Shanahan.--my intent, through governance and 
oversight within the JAIC, to put that structure in place, for 
the very reason that you said. We have to know what they're 
spending it on.
    Senator Heinrich. It all starts with knowing what we're 
doing----
    General Shanahan. Yes.
    Senator Heinrich.--and then building off of that. Do you 
have the authorities that you need to be able to do this part 
of your job effectively?
    General Shanahan. I'd say section 238 will grant those 
authorities. If I feel like we need any other authorities, 
we'll go back through the Department. But, I believe I have 
those authorities right now.
    Senator Heinrich. As we look at this over the course of the 
next couple budget years, what should we be measuring the JAIC 
against, in terms of metrics, and by what timeline?
    General Shanahan. When we talk about the JAIC, in 
capability delivery, I'll divide it up into product delivery 
and then the rest of the JAIC. Product delivery is, Are we 
delivering on the national mission initiatives and component 
mission initiatives? On the national mission initiatives, have 
we put results in place that are making a difference, with a 
return on investment? That won't be an instantaneous measure, 
even with Project Maven, which has been going for almost 2 full 
years right now. The return on investment takes a while to 
measure in AI. As we talked about yesterday at the National 
Security Commission, this is transformational. When you feel 
the first sprint 1 algorithms, they are not game-changing, 
they're designed for the operator to say, ``They're not good 
enough. Here's what I need to do and get to sprint 2, and we'll 
get to transformation.'' But, we need to show that we are 
delivering capabilities.
    For the component initiatives, I need to give an incentive 
for the services and components to come to the JAIC. How do I 
do that? One, funding. Two, joint common foundation, or a JAIC 
common foundation. ``I have data for you to use. I have tools. 
I have frameworks. I have some cloud and edge services. I have 
a--I'm a place that--one-stop shopping,'' which is a term that 
doesn't always work as well as it sounds on paper. But, I need 
to give people an incentive to come in to the JAIC, to help 
them accelerate their own AI initiatives.
    Yes, sir.
    Senator Heinrich. Yesterday at the AI Commission meeting, I 
thought it was really helpful, what you said about the cultural 
nature of this, and the multigenerational aspect of this. Talk 
about how we manage that. Because the people who manage it, 
yourself included, we're not going to have the same intuitive 
access to this world that the people getting out of coding 
schools right now have today. How, as the Pentagon, do you 
manage this cultural transition within such a large 
organization?
    General Shanahan. Well, I would put culture and talent 
management at the top two of my priorities in trying to change 
the Department in bringing artificial intelligence into it. As 
I said yesterday, there is a combination of top-down pressure 
and bottom-up innovation. For the most part, I believe the 
bottom-up innovation exists. We have to give it an outlet, a 
vehicle to give people room to go out and try things new and 
different, allow them to fail, and just show that they have a 
different way of doing business, that we can listen to them. 
There are now new programs in some of the departments, like 
Kessel Run with the Air Force. There is more and more of a 
culture change beginning to happen, but it's not part of the 
institution yet. What we have to do is institutionalize it. We 
have to give the top cover, in forms of resources, authorities, 
and policies, as well as going out and giving capabilities to 
people in the field.
    One of the things I say is that, absent somebody getting to 
play with AI, it's science fiction. They need----
    Senator Heinrich. Right,
    General Shanahan.--to see it, to smell it, to touch it and 
really see what it can and cannot do. And part of that is 
experimentation. It's almost like a war period between World 
War I and World War II, where we can go out and actually 
experiment with these capabilities. But, to do that, we have to 
develop the capabilities. It's a little bit of a vicious cycle. 
We have to get capabilities in the hand of operators and 
analysts, try them out, wargame with them, try new operating 
concepts, and then figuring out what works and doesn't work. 
That cycle is a little slow in getting going right now. When 
you ask about timeframe, I would say a year, in some respects, 
in terms of delivering capabilities; 2 years to begin to say, 
``Are we changing the Department?'' As you heard from Colonel 
Cukor yesterday, we're 2 years into this, and I would say not 
everybody accepts the change----
    Senator Heinrich. Yeah.
    General Shanahan.--that's coming.
    Senator Heinrich. Great. Thank you, General. Appreciate it.
    Senator Ernst. Thank you, Senator Heinrich.
    I think we'll go ahead and do a second round of questions. 
I will reserve my questions until the end so we can make sure 
that the rest of our Senators have an opportunity.
    Senator Peters, please go ahead.
    Senator Peters. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    General Shanahan, there is a concern out there by many 
about the possibility that AI-enabled systems and autonomous 
systems will cross some ethical lines, especially in 
operational settings. I know that the DOD AI Strategy includes 
efforts to think about AI ethics and safety issues are you're 
developing the systems. As you just said, you've got to get 
them out in the field, you've got to work them, but it probably 
makes sense to be thinking about this on the front end, as 
well, as we go forward.
    For the panel, here, if you could highlight for us what 
your biggest ethics-related concerns are for the possible use 
of AI systems by the military, and how you're working to 
address them.
    General Shanahan. Yes, Senator. Every technology introduced 
in the Department comes with a question of the lawful, safe, 
and ethical use of that technology. AI is not different in that 
respect. It has some differences, in terms of what you would 
call ``explainable AI.'' Is an AI making decisions based on 
data now instead of algorithms--rules-based algorithms that 
have been programmed into it? We are thinking about this from 
the very beginning.
    Based on my work in Project Maven, I can tell you the 
algorithms fielded are light years away from SKYNET and full 
autonomous weapon systems. But, we know we have to start 
thinking about the policy implications of that. If you were to 
ask where the highest temperature is outside the Department, 
it's on the question of lethal autonomous weapons. Autonomy in 
weapon systems is governed by DOD policy today, and we are 
partnered, and the JAIC is partnered, with the Defense 
Innovation Board, who has a year-long project underway about AI 
principles for defense, doing open hearings, being able to hear 
from anybody that wants to come in and talk about their 
concerns about the ethical, safe, and lawful use of artificial 
intelligence in DOD. I will tell you, it's something we take 
extremely seriously. We will go at this, as we have done with 
other technologies, through a very rigorous and disciplined 
test and evaluation, validation, and verification process. We 
have not fielded an algorithm in Project Maven without having 
gone through that rigorous and disciplined process. As early as 
we are, and as brittle as those algorithms are, we put them 
through that process. If we start talking about full autonomous 
systems, that level of rigor and discipline will only continue 
to increase.
    But, in terms of what we are most concerned about is its 
performance of algorithms. As Dr. Highnam said earlier, some of 
the algorithms have failure modes that we have to take into 
account. That DOD directive that I referred to, has several 
sections on what we have to go through in the Department to be 
ready to test and field technology that involves autonomy.
    But, autonomous weapon systems with artificial and general 
intelligence is what people seem to think is the worst case. I 
think of artificial narrow intelligence. Anything we field will 
be fielded in accordance with the Law of War, international 
humanitarian law, rules of engagement, and commanders' 
judgment. I mean, these are things that we take into account 
for every technology, even more so because people don't know 
all about the implications of artificial intelligence in a 
weapon system.
    Senator Peters. Yeah. As you go through that process, you 
know, certainly, that's encouraging, that that thought process 
is occurring within your organization, but I think we have to 
also realize that some of our adversaries may not be 
constrained by some of the same kinds of processes that we go 
through, and could present unacceptable risk to us, from a 
national security perspective, as well as the men and women who 
go in harm's way facing autonomous systems that operate under a 
completely--set of rules than what we would think is 
appropriate here in the United States.
    I think that leads to my last point, and that's thinking of 
some of these higher-level concerns and policy concerns of what 
we should be thinking about globally, in terms of these 
technologies. I know, when we were talking about AI, we often 
turn to technical experts and engineers. Often technical 
experts and engineers make comments about ethics. But, I have 
found that's a somewhat narrow approach, and we've made those 
kinds of mistakes in the past. My sense is--are you and Dr. 
Highnam--are you also working with philosophers and ethicists 
and folks who think deeply about some of the moral questions 
associated with these technologies? Or should we be doing more?
    Dr. Highnam. One, there's always more to do. We had an AI 
colloquium last week, a DARPA colloquium. About 700 people 
there. One of the most interesting panels that we had was on 
ethics, led by Richard Danzig, who used to be the Secretary of 
the Navy. Fascinating discussion. It's very much a part of the 
technical discussions that are going on. We are looking at 
that.
    Now, within--wearing a slightly more technical hat, there 
are some issues, at the moment, that we are very concerned 
about, with a technical solution. One is the implicit bias. The 
field of data science and machine learning or machine training 
have significant overlap. There's a tendency among people who 
are human, as they build these systems, to pick datasets, to 
cull datasets, to unintentionally put leads or, again, bias 
into how they're doing things, which means a system could 
preferentially recognize Joe or Jane, based on--just because of 
the way it was trained. That's a piece of the puzzle. We have 
research programs going directly against that. A large one 
underway now is understanding group biases. But, again, this is 
common to data science and machine training.
    The second area is about the deployment of technology when 
we don't fully understand its failure modes, back to the point 
I made earlier. One of our programs, short autonomy, has a very 
interesting premise, an important one. We have an autonomous 
vehicle, a flight vehicle, a ground vehicle. You can make it a 
lot more flexible in how it deals with unexpected conditions by 
adding some second-wave AI technologies to the puzzle. A 
condition shows up, it adapts and makes changes. But, it's--
again, if you don't really understand the failure modes, if you 
don't have that assurance and sense, almost, of a cyber 
assurance that this is going to behave itself and operate 
within safe limits, then you put something on the street or in 
the air that's--you really have to take a little--you have to 
think hard about before you do that. A lot of our research, 
again, is going into making technologies robust in that sense, 
as well. We have multiple programs--research programs 
addressing different aspects of this problem. It's a very 
important problem.
    Senator Peters. Great. Thank you.
    Senator Ernst. Senator Shaheen.
    Senator Shaheen. Thank you.
    Dr. Highnam, did I understand you correctly when you said: 
As we look at where AI is currently being developed in this 
country, about 50 percent of it is in large businesses; 14 
percent, small businesses; and a third from universities? Was 
that----
    Dr. Highnam. It's 50 percent in business, of which 14--so, 
14 percent, overall----
    Senator Shaheen. Ah. Okay.
    Dr. Highnam.--then 36 percent, larger businesses; 34 
percent universities; and the rest in service labs, energy 
labs, and so on.
    Senator Shaheen. The rest is from the public sector----
    Dr. Highnam. Yes.
    Senator Shaheen.--then.
    Dr. Highnam. Yeah.
    Senator Shaheen. If you think about past circumstances in 
our history, whether it was the Manhattan Project or putting a 
man on the Moon, can we analyze the sectors that provided that 
technological innovation, and figure out whether this is the 
right breakdown, in terms of where AI is coming from?
    Dr. Highnam. The answer is certainly yes. It's not 
something I've done. But, to comment on that, if I may, the--
this is the research phase. We're finding--these investments 
are not on systems that are in any sense deployable.
    Senator Shaheen. Sure.
    Dr. Highnam. But, these are people--I'm finding them in 
industry, with really good ideas, who propose to our research 
programs. Then, as much of this technology evolves, they 
publish some, they don't publish some, depending on----
    Senator Shaheen. Right.
    Dr. Highnam.--classification, and so on. But, a lot of the 
time, we want industry to make these technologies, as they are 
proven to work, to be commercial, to be incorporated into----
    Senator Shaheen. Right.
    Dr. Highnam.--other products that then the Department can 
buy back. I think that the days are gone when we can think 
about corralling hundreds of thousands or very large numbers of 
experts in such a hot technology area. We--this is normal--
DARPA's normal business mode, but I'm certainly going to take 
your question back for a look.
    Senator Shaheen. Well, I was just thinking about, How do we 
encourage more experimentation, more research? Thinking about 
small businesses. Small businesses create 16 times more patents 
than large businesses.
    Dr. Highnam. Yep.
    Senator Shaheen. You know, two out of every three jobs are 
created from small business. Are there ways we can incentivize 
small business to do more of that research and innovation that 
we're looking at to provide the AI that we need? I would argue 
that one program that is there that helps do that is the SBIR 
program----
    Dr. Highnam. Yeah.
    Senator Shaheen.--Small Business Innovation Research 
program.
    Dr. Highnam. Two answers. One--I'm sorry, it was part of my 
preamble--one of the things we've done in our AI campaign is to 
set up something called AI Exploration. In that, we post a 
topic of interest. Anybody is given 30 days to respond. It's 
typically schools and small businesses who do that. Then we 
award within 60 days after that. Ninety days from posting to 
award, up to a million dollars per award, up to about 18 months 
in duration. We've invested about 45 million so far, since 
September, in this activity. Because, you're right, this is a 
lot of the innovation, and this is us exploring in a space and 
giving them the grounds to do that. We've also recently 
revamped our small business approach to align it directly with 
our research programs. We're also encouraging moving directly 
to phase two. We also have an innovation accelerator, as well, 
to advise small businesses on how to take things commercial 
after they discover it, not just in AI, but across the board.
    Senator Shaheen. Are there other policy changes that we 
should be thinking about to promote--should we be encouraging 
more set-aside for SBIR programs? Are there other ways in which 
we can promote AI that we're not currently doing?
    For any of you?
    Dr. Highnam. We're seeing an awful lot of smart small 
businesses come forward, teaming with schools, teaming with big 
companies sometimes. Certainly those in the larger DARPA 
ecosystem understand how to work us.
    Mr. Brown. I think this just emphasizes what you've heard 
from all of us, the need to work with commercial innovators in 
?
    Senator Shaheen. Right.
    Mr. Brown.--AI. I saw an interesting statistic that came 
from Congressional Research Service recently, that, in the 
1960s, a third of the global R&D was U.S. defense-related, and 
now that number is 3.7 percent. It just speaks to the need to 
look outside. I think what you've heard from all of us--DIU, 
that's our mission, so of course you'd expect me to say that, 
but we heard it from Dr. Highnam, General Shanahan, that we 
want to work with these successful innovators outside, and 
bring that technology in, because, unlike the Manhattan Project 
working on one specific goal, AI is a horizontal technology 
that is infused in everything, or will be. That really speaks 
to the beauty of the U.S. capitalistic free-market system so 
that we can benefit from all that innovation happening across. 
I think our challenge is, Where do we pull that in, from a 
talent perspective, technology perspective, and proven use 
cases? How do those apply to the Defense Department?
    General Shanahan. Senator, it's about messaging that--as 
been said, AI, unlike any other technology in the past, is 
been--the equation has been completely turned around as 
commercial and not government. The message of--the United 
States Government, not just the Department of Defense, has an 
interest in promoting AI from the smallest company up to the 
biggest company. With Project Maven, we had no favorites. 
Everybody was a player, smallest startup all to the biggest 
companies in the United States. But, getting the message that 
we want the business, and if they have their intellectual 
property to work with the government on, we want to take that.
    What I don't want to see is some of the best companies in 
the United States, some of the best intellectual talent we have 
out there being funded with VC [venture capital] money from 
places like China. But, if they have to go somewhere, and we're 
not giving them an opportunity, that's what's going to happen.
    We have a role, I think. It's a very serious role, is to 
communicate that we're serious about artificial intelligence, 
we need the capabilities you bring to the table, and the three 
of us represented here from AI now to AI next, and Mr. Brown in 
between, sort of going out and doing the pilots and finding the 
right companies out there, that is a message we need to 
communicate. I think part of that, through the executive order 
on AI, but also the National Security Commission on AI that 
will come out with, I expect, some very weighty recommendations 
about a societal change in how we're looking at artificial 
intelligence.
    Senator Shaheen. Well, thank you. I appreciate all of those 
responses.
    If we're going to continue to be competitive in the rest of 
the world, then this needs to be part of our strategy. If 
you're correct, Mr. Brown, that in our system that unleashes 
all of this innovation in the private sector, then we should be 
able to win that competition. But, I think that there are 
policies that we need to put in place to encourage that, and we 
ought to think about which ones make sense to get where we want 
to go.
    Thank you all very much.
    Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Senator Ernst. Thank you. Absolutely.
    I will wrap up with just a couple questions. I do want to 
thank you for the discussion. We've covered a lot of territory, 
a lot of very interesting territory. I appreciate the 
discussion on ethics, as well, with lethal autonomous weapons. 
I think that's something that we need to fully vet and explore 
even more.
    But, what I'd like to do is turn back to the more mundane, 
everyday uses of AI, if we can. General Shanahan, you had--I 
think, had mentioned some of those uses. Of course, we have 
companies, like Amazon and UPS and Walmart, and they do use AI 
for those back-office types of tasks that you had mentioned 
earlier. Can you walk us through some of those tasks and where 
we might be able to utilize AI? Not big, sexy topics, but 
certainly if we can streamline the way we do business within 
the DOD, I think this would be helpful.
    General Shanahan. Yes, Senator. When you talk about smart 
automation, or, in the vernacular of the industry, ``robotic 
process automation,'' it's not headline-grabbing, in terms of 
big AI projects, but it may be where some of the most 
efficiencies can be found. That's the case if you read the 
dailies in industry, whether it's in medicine or in finance. 
This is where early gains are being realized in AI. Some of the 
other projects we take on in the Department are probably years 
in the making of return on investment. These other areas, I 
think, will be much shorter-term return on investment.
    What we're trying to do in the JAIC--when I looked at this 
just a couple of months ago, we weren't even concentrating on 
this smart automation. I'm now trying to figure out how I stand 
up a small office just focused on that. I don't see us leading 
that, but it's leading others to find out how to incorporate 
these technologies into their back-office functions.
    I've already met with the Chief Management Officer of the 
Department, as well as the Chief Data Officer of the 
Department, to have these early discussions. I'm convinced 
there will be lots of opportunities in back-office functions, 
finance being, I'd say, the first one to take on, to help 
augment people. I think people get very concerned, right off 
the bat, about being replaced. There's not enough people to go 
around, for the most part, so this is about augmenting people 
and being able to do much more work than they were able to do 
with the tools, which, in some cases, are far too old, manual, 
laborious. These are about how to--if you see the 
demonstrations of a bot versus a human doing the same sort of 
manual task, there's no question who gets to the finish line 
first.
    Senator Ernst. Absolutely.
    General Shanahan. We're early in this process right now. 
But, that's one I'm very interested in taking.
    Senator Ernst. No, I think that's really important. One of 
the big discussions that we've had, just in the last year, was 
the DOD audit, and how do we arrive at a clean audit through 
such a large--what I describe as a large, you know, animal. Is 
it practical to look at an application like that? Would it be 
helpful to guide us towards a clean audit?
    General Shanahan. I'd say the answer to that is yes. 
Scoping it will be the challenge, is finding out how big this 
is to go after the audit. But, I know the Chief Data Officer, 
Michael Conlin, is looking at applications like this. There are 
big decisions made in the Department with data done in a very 
manually intensive way. If those decisions can be made faster 
and better, that, of course, is something that the leadership 
of the Department is interested in.
    The answer to your question is yes. It's a question of 
understanding the scope and the scale of doing it.
    Senator Ernst. Very good.
    Of course, the inventory purposes, acquisition, program 
spending, you name it, I think that AI can help in those areas. 
It has been mentioned, maintenance, as well--predictive 
maintenance on equipment and aircraft, so forth, would be very 
helpful, as well.
    General Shanahan. Senator, if I may just add on to the 
point. Whether it's smart automation or predictive 
maintenance--as we're finding very early, the problems 
themselves are not massive, but the lessons learned are what 
we're really catching on to.
    Just one use case of a helicopter, seemingly simple. But, 
everything we're learning about data management, which would be 
no surprise to anybody in industry who's dealing with 
artificial intelligence and machine learning. But, those are 
what we're trying to collate and bring up to a higher level for 
the Department about understanding what different standards, 
policies, authorities need to be in place to make this happen 
against all the different aircraft in the Department of 
Defense.
    To your other point about--I call it a flywheel effect. 
Once a few people begin to understand what smart automation 
does, it will catch on. But, nobody believes it yet, because 
they haven't the benefit of actually seeing it work.
    Senator Ernst. Absolutely.
    General Shanahan. But, that's what we have to do, is--we 
have to show--it's the show-me piece. We have to have people 
believe it's real, and not just science fiction.
    Senator Ernst. Absolutely.
    With that, I will go ahead and wrap up this hearing today. 
I do want to thank the members of our panel for being here. The 
flywheel effect, it starts here, as well, in Congress, and 
making sure that we are educating others on artificial 
intelligence and the applications for our DOD.
    Thank you, again, to the witnesses for being here and for 
educating us on what your jobs entail and how we can better use 
artificial intelligence. Thank you, gentlemen, very much.
    This concludes the hearing of Emerging Threats and 
Capabilities.
    [Whereupon, at 3:53 p.m., the Subcommittee adjourned.]

    [Questions for the record with answers supplied follow:]
              Questions Submitted by Senator Joni K. Ernst
                        ai to improve processes
    1. Senator Ernst. Dr. Highnam and Mr. Brown, how can DOD 
[Department of Defense] use AI to improve its business and back office 
processes to save money for readiness missions?
    Dr. Highnam. There are many commercial companies offering AI-based 
solutions for business and back office processes. However, the 
implementation, customization and deployment effort for such a project 
is complex and subject to schedule and performance risks. Back-office 
operations have been studied in-depth for decades, and many 
sophisticated computer algorithms are routinely used in currently 
deployed enterprise solutions. Nonetheless, an AI technology system 
requires a software layer that captures user actions and business 
processes in a computer-readable form. To be successful, AI methods 
must access disjoint databases and combine financial reports with 
computer-interpretable information about human decision processes. A 
graduated approach to adopting AI techniques would first automate 
repeatable processes while also capturing human responses to 
nonstandard situations. Computer-readable information about human 
responses would then provide the data required to test if and when AI 
methods might further improve business processes. Offerings claiming to 
provide value through the application of AI technologies should be 
vetted thoroughly and their life-cycle-costs analyzed and compared to 
best practice in the commercial world and to current solutions. 
Superior solutions would both enable end users to automate repeatable 
processes and learn from user behavior to recommend courses of action 
for non-standard situations.
    Mr. Brown. Based on routinely collected data, artificial 
intelligence (AI), data analytics and machine learning technologies are 
well-suited to make predictions to improve back office processes. For 
example, commercially available software for robotic process automation 
is the use of software with AI and machine learning capabilities to 
handle high-volume, repeatable tasks that previously required humans to 
perform. These tasks can include queries, calculations, and maintenance 
of records and transactions.

    2. Senator Ernst. Dr. Highnam and Mr. Brown, for example, can AI-
enabled systems help DOD achieve a clean audit, better track inventory 
and acquisition program spending, or assist in the personnel assignment 
process?
    Dr. Highnam. The goal of an audit is to ensure compliance with a 
complex set of regulations. To achieve this goal requires extensive 
common-sense and organization-specific knowledge. For example, a 
financial auditor must be deeply familiar with the Generally Accepted 
Accounting Principles (GAAP) and understand they should be applied to 
the organization in question. For the DOD, a thorough knowledge of the 
Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARs) would also be 
essential. The application of such knowledge is well beyond current AI 
capabilities. AI tools can assist auditors by enabling more rapid 
analysis of data relevant to the audit. For example, machine-learning 
systems can be trained to detect fraudulent transactions. However, the 
use of such tools requires years of training and experience. The DOD 
may be able to achieve cost savings in audits through judicious 
incorporation of automated processes and AI technologies. Nonetheless, 
the DOD faces unique challenges related to scale, expiration of funds, 
and operational diversity. It is unlikely that common commercial 
products will fully address DOD use cases without extensions or 
modifications. Graduated solutions should first advance the level of 
automation while providing a software foundation for future AI 
deployments. Finally, decades of research have produced well-
established procedures and mathematical concepts for managing 
inventory, such as logistic regression for demand forecasting and 
Economic Order Quantity estimation. Machine learning techniques may 
potentially improve demand forecasts, but DOD should undertake a 
careful analysis of any AI-based solution to ensure that its lifecycle 
costs and complexity do not exceed current solutions, without 
substantial increase in accuracy and timeliness. Similar caveats apply 
to other areas of business process automation, such as personnel 
assignment.
    Mr. Brown. Although not a focus area of DIU at the moment, there 
are a number of commercially available data analytics platforms that 
make this information more visible.

    3. Senator Ernst. Dr. Highnam and Mr. Brown, what specifically have 
your organizations done to support AI for back-office functions at DOD?
    Dr. Highnam. DARPA creates foundational AI components that 
generalize to a variety of application areas. DARPA recently engaged in 
a knowledge exchange with DFAS and DISA to explore whether DARPA AI 
components might support back-office functions within the DOD. Several 
near term investments would need to be made to lay the foundation for 
future pilot testing and deployment of AI technologies from DARPA and 
other organizations. Specifically, the DOD would need to invest in a 
software layer that enables users to automate routine business 
processes and stores the actions taken by humans to address non-
standard situations. Ideally, the software layer would connect disjoint 
databases and software tools in a manner that builds on users' current 
workflows, captures an ontology of user actions, and stores relevant 
data in a computer-readable form. The software layer would provide a 
foundation for pilot tests, extensions, and rapid deployment of AI 
components from DARPA and other organizations. There will be a follow-
up meeting between DARPA, DFAS, and DISA.
    Mr. Brown. DIU has been working with a commercial solution on AF 
strategic planning choices to predict necessary POM inputs for given 
decisions. The use cases center around using integrated data (current 
and historical: budget; financial execution; manpower; personnel; and 
logistics/equipment) to identify 3rd, 4th and 5th order effects of a 
given planning choice. The intent is to improve fidelity in the 
strategic planning process, and understand quantitatively the likely 
outcomes on readiness, manning, equipment needs, training impacts, and 
other weapon systems. There is both a quality and speed component to 
decision making. Using a tool increases the throughput of decisions 
through the budgeting process, and provides more fidelity so senior 
leaders and analysts can ask the questions that will help them improve 
decisions.
                       dod technology acquisition
    4. Senator Ernst. Dr. Highnam, Mr. Brown, and Lt. General Shanahan, 
how does the DOD acquisition process delay the development and 
implementation of AI and other emerging technologies and what efforts 
have you taken to address this problem?
    Dr. Highnam. DOD acquisition is often process driven, rather than 
mission driven like DARPA. The state of the art of emerging technology 
like AI evolves much faster than DOD acquisition timelines. For this 
reason, DARPA uses streamlined or rapid acquisition authorities to 
connect with the best people and technology at the speed of innovation. 
For example, DARPA has used ``Other Transaction'' authorities for 
decades because they allow flexibility and often faster results than 
traditional government contracting. Recently, DARPA launched the 
Artificial Intelligence Exploration (AIE) program to execute forty-
eight (48) separate Other Transaction awards totaling $45 million, for 
rapid feasibility studies of AI concepts lasting eighteen (18) months. 
To keep pace with industry changes, DARPA's AIE awards had an average 
timeline of less than ninety (90) days from announcement to award.
    Mr. Brown. DIU's mission is to look beyond traditional DOD vendors 
and focus on the commercial technology community. To attract these 
commercial solutions, DIU developed the Commercial Solutions Opening 
(CSO) process in 2016, a three-phase, competitive merit-based business 
model leveraging prototype Other Transaction authority. This process 
has enabled DIU to focus on balancing speed, flexibility, and 
collaboration to award prototype projects to leading-edge, dual-use 
technology companies that might otherwise not do business with DOD. A 
potential future problem would be the length of time to get new vendors 
cleared to solve some of our problems.
    Lt. Gen. Shanahan. The Department of Defense's acquisition process 
is still oriented primarily towards materiel weapon systems rather than 
software development. Modern software development requires a different 
process, with end-users providing feedback at every stage and 
developers continually refining the model after deployment. In pursuit 
of our mission needs, the JAIC is taking advantage of current 
regulations and policies wherever possible to implement proven 
iterative development strategies for software and emerging technologies 
such as AI. Based on my previous experience with Project Maven, there 
is often sufficient flexibility within the Defense Federal Acquisition 
Regulation Supplement (DFARS), but to navigate the DFARS successfully 
requires government personnel with a commensurate level of experience 
and deep understanding of DOD acquisition and contracting regulations. 
Further simplification of existing regulations will be helpful. The 
JAIC is seeking to hire people with the requisite agile acquisition 
expertise while also reviewing a wide range of acquisition and 
contracting options designed to allow maximum flexibility and agility 
when pursuing commercial AI solutions. The JAIC will work closely with 
USD (Research and Engineering) and USD (Acquisition and Sustainment) on 
improving AI-related acquisition and contracting policies and 
authorities. Congress has been especially helpful in crafting 
legislation designed to expedite fielding commercial AI technologies.

    5. Senator Ernst. Dr. Highnam, Mr. Brown, and Lt. General Shanahan, 
have you faced any roadblocks in the Department to speeding up 
acquisition of these technologies?
    Dr. Highnam. DARPA has not faced any roadblocks. DARPA consistently 
uses a wide variety of existing acquisition flexibilities granted by 
Congress, such as the ``Other Transaction authority'', which we have 
used for decades. The Artificial Intelligence Exploration (AIE) program 
was an example of DARPA using ``Other Transaction authorities'' to make 
forty-eight (48) awards with an average timeline of less than ninety 
(90) days from announcement to award. DARPA greatly appreciates the 
acquisition autonomy and flexibility that Congress and the Department 
grants us due to our unique R&D mission of pursuing breakthrough 
technology and avoiding strategic surprise. DARPA's success so far has 
resulted from this autonomy and flexibility, and our future success 
depends on our ability to use a variety of special acquisition 
authorities to pursue innovative R&D.
    Mr. Brown. DIU has had a beneficial partnership with Army 
Contracting Command--New Jersey (ACC-NJ) for contract execution, but 
reliance on contracting organizations with other primary missions has 
been unable to meet DIU's capacity needs and higher DOD demand. In 
November 2018, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for 
Acquisition and Sustainment (OUSD (A&S)) granted DIU authority to 
execute ``Other Transaction agreements.'' In April 2019, DIU utilized 
this new authority to release its first solicitation, the initial step 
in awarding a prototype contract.
    Lt. Gen. Shanahan. Not at this point, although we acknowledge the 
risks inherent in not taking full advantage of a wide range of 
acquisition and contracting practices that support agile development, 
fielding, and sustainment. During the JAIC's initial standup in fiscal 
year 2019, to avoid incurring delays in each of our three primary 
projects, the JAIC has primarily taken advantage of existing contract 
vehicles. As we prepare to scale operations in fiscal year 2020, we are 
using lessons learned from other DOD-wide AI projects such as Maven to 
create and combine a wide variety of new and existing contract 
vehicles, respectively, that will provide the JAIC and others in DOD 
with access to state-of-the-art AI technology and services, at the 
necessary speed and with the required agility. We will be prepared to 
request new or modified policies, authorities, and legislation as 
necessary.
                               __________
             Questions Submitted by Senator Mazie K. Hirono
                           ethical challenges
    6. Senator Hirono. General Shanahan, the ethical use of AI is an 
issue that must be adequately addressed before AI can be deployed in a 
widespread and meaningful way. Who within DOD is responsible for issues 
regarding the ethical use of AI within DOD?
    Lt. Gen. Shanahan. Leadership in values and ethics is at the core 
of everything we do in the JAIC. The responsibility for the ethical use 
of AI will be widely shared across the Department, spanning system 
developers, trainers, leaders, end users, and more. The breadth of this 
shared responsibility is a recognition that many different communities 
within DOD have a critical role to play in getting this right. The JAIC 
will play a central role in helping craft policies, guidelines, and 
authorities related to the ethical, safe, and lawful use of AI 
technologies. This includes working with allies, partners, and 
international organizations on questions of international norms for AI, 
while precluding unnecessary restrictions on our development and 
fielding of AI capabilities. The Department is fully committed to the 
ethical use of AI from concept through deployment and sustainment. This 
includes ensuring sufficient rigor and discipline throughout test and 
evaluation as well as validation and verification processes and 
procedures.

    7. Senator Hirono. General Shanahan, are there separate efforts to 
address ethical issues related to the uses of AI and the issues related 
to AI systems potentially generating errors or unwanted outcomes?
    Lt. Gen. Shanahan. The Defense Innovation Board (DIB) is developing 
principles to guide current and future AI research, applications, and 
activities as part of the AI Principles for Defense project. Upon 
completion of the project, the DIB will make a recommendation to the 
Secretary of Defense on proposed AI principles for defense, at which 
point the Department will conduct an internal review process on 
adopting such principles. Additionally, a major component of DARPA's 
`AI Next' campaign, titled Explainable AI, focuses on enabling AI 
systems to explain their actions. Progress in ``explainable AI'' will 
help users understand, appropriately trust, and use AI systems in an 
ethical and safe manner. Prior to fielding any AI capabilities, the 
Department will ensure sufficient rigor and discipline in test and 
evaluation processes and procedures with particular attention to 
independent evaluations and assessments, errors, biases, and unwanted 
outcomes. This will include establishing dynamic feedback loops that 
take into account feedback from operational users on algorithm or model 
performance on deployed systems.
                         predictive maintenance
    8. Senator Hirono. General Shanahan, one of the areas of focus for 
JAIC [Joint Artificial Intelligence Center] that seems particularly 
promising is predictive maintenance. The ability to improve readiness 
by limiting downtime with predictive maintenance could have a 
tremendous positive effect on maintenance efforts across DOD. What are 
the major hurdles to widespread deployment of predictive maintenance AI 
within DOD?
    Lt. Gen. Shanahan. I agree that machine learning (ML) looks 
particularly promising in terms of augmenting, accelerating, and 
automating current maintenance practices. The JAIC funded predictive 
maintenance as one of its initial National Mission Initiatives because 
of the near-term opportunity to increase aircraft readiness, aligning 
with the Secretary of Defense's direction to improve aircraft readiness 
across the Department. However, one of the earliest identified 
challenges, which matches lessons learned from Project Maven and other 
previous DOD AI/ML projects, centers on data: its quality, 
accessibility, and relationship to ground truth. Existing maintenance 
data is often not at the level necessary for AI systems development. 
Critical data elements are often missing, incorrect, or at too low 
resolution. Additionally, data inconsistencies exist across the 
Services for related systems. One of the JAIC's roles will be to help 
develop and implement DOD-wide policies, authorities, and governance 
designed to improve data readiness across the entire Department. This 
will include supporting efforts to digitize end-to-end processes, from 
the back office to the tactical edge.

    9. Senator Hirono. General Shanahan, where does DOD need to invest 
to widely deploy predictive maintenance?
    Lt. Gen. Shanahan. Predictive maintenance should be employed widely 
across the Department. AI-enabling investments in data generation, 
curation, data access, and maintenance are necessary precursors to 
enable predictive maintenance AI to be successful at scale. Data 
curation is one of the most important investments, along with needed 
requirements to improve data quality at the point of use. In the 
interim, the JAIC is relying on AI and domain experts to conduct 
standardized post-processing of inaccurate and missing data. While our 
initial H-60 helicopter use case is relatively small, the lessons we 
are identifying in this project--particularly as they relate to data 
management--will be applicable to every future project in DOD. 
Investments in ontology, component standards, and use of a common 
infrastructure are addressing challenges with data access. Shared 
ontology ensures a common data lexicon across the Joint Force--an 
important step toward scaling new AI-capabilities. The JAIC is 
supporting a number of ongoing standards-related efforts including 
those led by the National Institute for Standards and Technology. If 
such data standards are established and uniformly adopted, then it will 
help DOD ensure future equipment procurements include government 
ownership of data needed to efficiently apply AI analysis.

    10. Senator Hirono. General Shanahan, will predictive maintenance 
AI be deployable at sea, where ships have traditionally been limited in 
computing power and communications bandwidth?
    Lt. Gen. Shanahan. The JAIC's Predictive Maintenance National 
Mission Initiative uses historical H-60 helicopter data. However, the 
Navy maintenance community has already raised the challenge of limited 
communication bandwidth as partially explaining missing data that is 
necessary for AI analysis. The Navy is working through the connectivity 
requirement between the Integrated Mechanical Diagnostics System (IMDS) 
and TRIAD shipboard servers to ensure maximum use of AI technology at 
the point of use. This is an area where the JAIC will work closely with 
the Navy and Marine Corps to identify and address specific challenges 
related to deploying AI-enabled predictive maintenance solutions at sea 
or in any degraded, disconnected, intermittent, or bandwidth-limited 
environment.

             Questions Submitted by Senator Martin Heinrich
                     commercial industry engagement
    11. Senator Heinrich. Mr. Brown, I am aware that you have DIU 
[Defense Innovation Unit] offices set up in Silicon Valley, Boston, and 
Austin. I'd like to make sure that AI startup companies, say in 
Albuquerque, Santa Fe, Des Moines, or Detroit have the same 
opportunities to present their AI solutions for your problem sets. How 
should they go about doing so?
    Mr. Brown. DIU is interested in getting the best commercial 
solutions from around the country and growing the national security 
innovation base. To date, we have received submissions from over 800 
companies in 42 states and the District of Columbia. We post an Area of 
Interest (AOI) solicitation on our website, www.diu.mil, to which 
companies across the country can submit proposals.

    12. Senator Heinrich. Mr. Brown, is New Mexico within your upcoming 
outreach efforts? If not, I would like to extend a personal invitation 
to visit New Mexico and meet with several cutting-edge AI companies.
    Mr. Brown. Thank you for the invitation. We have recently met with 
your congressional lead about our processes and opportunities to work 
with DIU. We have a number of companies that have responded to our 
AOIs. We will definitely look to visit New Mexico in upcoming travels 
nearby.
                            the cloud and ai
    13. Senator Heinrich. Mr. Brown and Lt. Gen. Shanahan, as you know, 
the cloud contract and process itself, JEDI, has received significant 
attention. In general, how important is the establishment of a cloud to 
supporting the deployment of future AI capabilities?
    Mr. Brown. The establishment of a cloud solution to support the 
deployment of future AI capabilities is very important. Most vendors in 
the AI/ML space are moving toward cloud services to provide their most 
advanced capabilities, so it is a high priority to establish and 
migrate to cloud infrastructure to stay current with the vendor base. 
Large training data sets and substantial/scalable computational 
resources are two core capabilities that enable effective artificial 
intelligence applications. Cloud solutions enable those datasets to be 
shared across geographically separated commands, pooling together 
larger datasets. Cloud computing allows a far more efficient allocation 
of DOD capital, as the precise amount of computational resources are 
spun up to solve the specific problem and no idle capacity is being 
paid for.
    Lt. Gen. Shanahan. Achieving the most effective results possible 
from AI-enabled technologies will depend on a future of enterprise 
cloud. The cloud provides massive and elastic compute power, lower 
latency, unlimited storage, and scalability. It will also enable local 
and global dynamic algorithm and model updates at the required speeds 
that will be essential to future multi-domain operations. The JAIC's 
objective is to use AI to solve large and complex problems to ensure 
that the Services and Components have real-time access to ever-
improving libraries of data sets, reusable tools, frameworks, and 
standards. This cannot be achieved without the foundational framework 
established by a hybrid solution of general purpose and fit-for-purpose 
enterprise clouds, in accordance with DOD's enterprise cloud strategy

    14. Senator Heinrich. Mr. Brown and Lt. Gen. Shanahan, is it 
possible to deploy AI capabilities without cloud or clouds in place?
    Mr. Brown. Yes. Many of our prototypes are either ``on premises'' 
(non-cloud) deployments, or hybrids that have both on premise and cloud 
elements. It is possible to deploy trained algorithms at the edge with 
a ``train in cloud, deploy at edge'' concept of operations. 
Furthermore, it is also possible to deploy additional processing power 
at the edge with some of the more advanced hardware available from 
vendors. However, the core benefits of AI/ML solutions come into play 
when we pool together many data sources in a common operating 
environment.
    Lt. Gen. Shanahan. It is possible to develop and field AI-enabled 
capabilities without a cloud. However, such `one-off' solutions will 
limit the overall effectiveness of deployed capabilities--everything 
from training through inference at the tactical edge and dynamic 
updates to deployed algorithms/models. It is possible to deploy limited 
AI capabilities in traditional data centers and on-premise 
infrastructures; data centers are generally cost prohibitive and suffer 
from a number of other limitations lowering the ability to achieve 
maximum effectiveness from AI technologies. AI deployment at scale 
requires the elasticity of compute and storage that is afforded by 
cloud computing, while also accounting for compute hosted on platforms 
and sensors at the tactical edge. The full potential of an AI-enabled 
future depends on enterprise cloud that is optimized for AI, with 
sufficient backup measures in place to account for operations in 
degraded, disconnected, intermittent, or bandwidth-limited 
environments.
                           ethics and safety
    15. Senator Heinrich. Dr. Highnam and Lt Gen Shanahan, how is the 
Department of Defense addressing ethics and safety concerns surrounding 
military applications of AI?
    Dr. Highnam. The safe use of AI technologies by the military and 
others is an important concern of AI researchers and practitioners. 
DARPA is addressing this concern in multiple research programs, 
including its Assured Autonomy program. The Assured Autonomy program is 
developing rigorous design and analysis technologies for continual 
assurance of learning-enabled autonomous systems to guarantee safety 
properties in uncertain environments. These include new techniques for 
modeling and system design, formal verification, simulation-based 
testing, machine learning, and safety-assured learning. The 
technologies being developed in the Assured Autonomy program will 
enable the DOD to more rapidly and efficiently deploy learning-enabled 
autonomous systems that can be trusted to operate safely in uncertain 
environments. DARPA's recent AI Colloquium featured an ethics panel 
with in-depth discussion of ethical issues relevant to AI in military 
contexts: https://youtu.be/jSxCWLJt0wY.
    Lt. Gen. Shanahan. The Department continues it full commitment to 
the ethical, safe, and lawful use of AI. Leadership in values and 
ethics is at the core of everything we do in the JAIC. One of the key 
pillars of DOD's AI Strategy is leading in military ethics and AI 
safety. JAIC will support ethical implementation of AI by consulting 
with leaders across academia, industry, and the international 
community; investing in resilient, robust, reliable, secure, and 
explainable AI systems; developing and improving policies that that 
consider technical strengths and limitations of AI; and pioneering 
approaches for AI test, evaluation, verification, and validation. 
Concurrently, the JAIC will implement AI as required to maintain 
battlefield overmatch in alignment with the national defense strategy. 
There is no inherent contradiction between the ethical and safe 
integration of artificial intelligence across the range of military 
operations, and meeting the Department's enduring mission to deter war 
and protect the security of our nation. Artificial intelligence is a 
critical capability to ensure we field a lethal, resilient, and rapidly 
adapting Joint Force. The responsibility for the ethical use of AI will 
be widely shared across the Department, spanning system developers, 
trainers, leaders, end users, and more. The breadth of this shared 
responsibility is a recognition that many different communities within 
DOD have a critical role to play in getting this right, although the 
JAIC will play a central role in helping craft policies, guidelines, 
and authorities related to the ethical, safe, and lawful use of AI 
technologies. The Department is fully committed to the ethical use of 
AI from concept through deployment and sustainment. This includes 
ensuring sufficient rigor and discipline in test and evaluation as well 
as validation and verification. Prior to fielding any AI capabilities, 
the Department will ensure sufficient rigor and discipline in test and 
evaluation processes and procedures. This will include dynamic feedback 
loops that take into account feedback from operational users on 
deployed algorithms or models.
                     component mission initiatives
    16. Senator Heinrich. Lt Gen Shanahan, you stated that you expect 
to see a rapid growth of Component Mission Initiatives, or CMI's in 
fiscal year 2020. Can you talk more about why and what those new CMI's 
will look like?
    Lt. Gen. Shanahan. Since the establishment of the JAIC, we have 
been interacting closely with the military Services and other DOD 
Components to explore how the JAIC can support their requests for AI-
enabled solutions to a wide variety of potential challenges. This 
includes working with them on potential future CMIs. At present, these 
range from operational planning through predictive medicine, 
identifying individuals at risk of harming themselves, force 
protection, and information operations. We are further developing our 
internal JAIC governance framework to shape, prioritize, and recommend 
CMIs to ensure there are no duplicative efforts and to ascertain proper 
levels of support, from personnel resourcing to funding. Additionally, 
the establishment of the JAIC Common Foundation (JCF) will enable us to 
better support CMIs in the coming fiscal year.

    17. Senator Heinrich. Lt Gen Shanahan, does the budget request 
reflect the rapid growth of CMI's you anticipate?
    Lt. Gen. Shanahan. Yes. We anticipate allocating about $30 million 
to support six to ten CMIs in fiscal year 2020. Dedicated funding for 
CMIs will incentivize the services and components to rely on the JAIC 
while supporting the maturity of the JAIC Common Foundation (JCF), a 
crucial enabling capability for CMIs and National Mission Initiatives 
(NMI). As the JCF matures it will become a repository of tools, 
frameworks, processes, and data to accelerate new CMIs throughout the 
DOD. We expect a growing demand for CMI support through fiscal year 
2020 and beyond; the current fiscal year 2020 budget request is 
currently projected to accommodate all expected CMI support through the 
end of fiscal year 2020.
                    computer science and recruitment
    18. Senator Heinrich. Lt Gen Shanahan, you stated that in terms of 
AI, adding funding and people will not by themselves spark the 
necessary level of institutional change we need, and that we need a 
deeper foundation of people who understand the technology and computer 
sciences. Do you believe the Department currently prioritizes 
recruitment for computer sciences?
    Lt. Gen. Shanahan. There is more work to do in this area. Similar 
to the lessons learned across DOD over the past decade with the rapid 
growth of cyberspace, there is awareness the Department needs to 
accelerate efforts to grow, recruit, retain, and promote people with 
the kinds of skills necessary to thrive in an AI-enabled future. This 
is a multi-generational challenge, though there are a number of 
different near- and medium-term efforts that can begin to improve 
current shortfalls. These include targeted recruiting; recruiting 
incentives; introducing AI and coding principles in grade schools, high 
schools, and military entry-level education and training programs; 
retention bonuses; intermediate and advanced training throughout a 
career; exchanges with industry; and relying on commercial companies to 
accelerate the breadth and depth of AI experience across the DOD. The 
Services' Reserve Officer Training Corps and Service Academies remain 
committed to producing future officers with strong academic foundations 
in computer science. Moreover, the Services collaborate with industry 
leaders to advance the essential skills needed by these officers in 
many technical fields. For the enlisted force, the Services primarily 
select individuals with related qualifications and train them 
internally for AI-oriented positions. Specialized tests are 
administered by the Services to identify individuals with an aptitude 
for assignment into computer career fields. Our civilian workforce also 
helps to meet the needs of the Department not fulfilled by military 
personnel. Concomitant with efforts across DOD to close significant 
gaps in AI knowledge and expertise, we need a whole-of-society approach 
to further develop a cadre of people with the requisite skills in AI 
and AI-associated fields. Absent such an approach, the DOD will 
continue to compete with industry, academia, and other government 
agencies for an extremely limited pool of AI expertise. It is vital to 
grow the entire base of expertise across society, rather than focus 
only on the very small pool of AI talent that already exists within 
DOD.

    19. Senator Heinrich. Lt Gen Shanahan, what are your thoughts on 
establishing ``computer sciences'' as a core competency within the 
military? (i.e., career tracks, mission specialties)
    Lt. Gen. Shanahan. Under Title 10 of the United States Codes the 
responsibility for training falls within the Services. Each Service 
reviews and updates their core competencies to best reflect the 
national defense strategy, changes in the operational environment, and 
available technology. Given the immediate need for substantially more 
expertise in AI and AI-related skills--from computer scientists to data 
architects, data engineers, system engineers and more--I am the 
strongest possible proponent for an approach in which the Services 
consider how best to represent this need in their core competencies. 
The JAIC will work closely with the Services, OSD, and DOD Components 
to propose and advance necessary authorities, policies, and legislation 
designed to grow a more qualified AI force.

    20. Senator Heinrich. Lt Gen Shanahan, given how important STEM 
[Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math] is to your efforts, should 
there be someone in the Department entrusted with recruiting 
individuals specifically for that type of skill set?
    Lt. Gen. Shanahan. Each Service is best positioned to determine the 
optimum approach to meet their recruiting mission and training 
requirements. As the recruiting environment has become more 
challenging, I am confident, if deemed appropriate, each Service will 
consider other initiatives, including specialty recruiting, that will 
enable them to achieve their recruiting missions. I view one of the 
JAIC's key responsibilities as helping the Services and other 
Components assess their AI workforce strengths, limitations, and 
shortfalls, and helping them craft strategies centered on AI talent 
recruiting, retention, and promotion.
                       breakout of dod ai funding
    21. Senator Heinrich. Lt Gen Shanahan, the fiscal year 2020 budget 
request includes a $927 million investment in Artificial Intelligence, 
with money directed toward the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center and 
Advanced Image Recognition (Project Maven). Can you please provide the 
breakdown on how the $927 million will be allocated?
    Lt. Gen. Shanahan. The $927 million is allocated among three major 
AI programs in DOD: Joint Artificial Intelligence Center ($268 
million), Project Maven ($250 million), and Defense Advanced Research 
Projects Agency (DARPA) ($409 million). (The overall budget for all DOD 
AI programs is classified and can be provided separately upon request.) 
The Joint Artificial Intelligence Center was established in June 2018 
to accelerate the delivery of AI-enabled capabilities. Project Maven's 
efforts are focused on ISR full motion video and expanding to other 
areas that include high altitude still imagery and captured enemy 
materials. Through its ``AI Next'' campaign, DARPA is developing 
advanced AI theory and applications making it possible for machines to 
adapt contextually to changing situations.

    22. Senator Heinrich. Lt Gen Shanahan, one impediment to accurately 
evaluating funding levels for AI is the lack of a stand-alone AI 
Program Element (PE) in DOD funding tables. As a result, AI R&D 
[Research and development] appropriations are spread throughout 
generally titled PEs and incorporated into funding for larger systems 
with AI components. As the lead coordinating entity for AI, do you have 
visibility on the Department of Defense's total investment in AI, 
including Services and components, and can you provide that breakdown 
to the Committee by PE and amounts?
    Lt. Gen. Shanahan. I agree that we need better visibility on the 
entire range of spending on AI and AI-related projects across DOD. The 
Department of Defense's total AI funding was classified Secret by the 
Acting Secretary of Defense and can be provided separately upon 
request. Current procedures require the military Services and DOD 
Components to coordinate with the JAIC on all AI-related projects over 
$15 million. For fiscal year 2020, we are relying on data calls by OSD-
CAPE and USD-Comptroller to gather all AI-related funding information. 
DOD CIO will capture AI investments in the IT Budget starting in fiscal 
year 2021. Through updates in policy and institution of DOD AI 
governance, Components will be mandated to enter their AI projects in 
the DOD portal to be reflected in the Select & Native Programming Data 
Input System for Information Technology SNaP-IT exhibit. These are 
necessary first steps towards gaining a more comprehensive 
understanding of all AI-related spending across the Department. As part 
of our evolving JAIC governance framework, we will propose new 
processes and procedures to ensure greater oversight of DOD-wide AI 
spending; this will include spending by the DOD components of the 
intelligence community.
                               __________
             Questions Submitted by Senator Gary C. Peters
                  google workforce objections to maven
    23. Senator Peters. Lt. Gen. Shanahan, the decision by Google to 
pull out the Maven program raises many concerns. What is your 
assessment of why Google pulled out of the Maven project and what steps 
are you taking and what steps are these companies taking to ensure that 
we can work with the best minds in Silicon Valley on these important 
efforts?
    Lt. Gen. Shanahan. Google's contribution to Project Maven was as a 
subcontractor to a prime contractor. They were one of many 
subcontractors associated with the project and they had no direct 
contractual relationship with Project Maven or the JAIC. They completed 
their statement of work as subcontracted and publicly withdrew from 
future consideration of a potential subcontract renewal or extension. 
The decision was based on entirely internal factors and Google only 
provided to the government limited information as to the private 
business considerations of that decision. It would be inappropriate for 
the Department to speculate as to the underlying rationale for that 
decision as private industry has the right to engage in contracts as 
they see fit. Nonetheless, the Google/Maven issue underscores that the 
DOD needs to improve its efforts to acquire, configure, and deploy 
commercial artificial intelligence technology, which requires adapting 
to the culture and business practices of a new, more diverse group of 
industry partners. The vast majority of current AI companies do not 
rely on DOD as a substantial part of their AI business model. Their 
employees may have different motivations and ethical concerns about 
engaging in national security work. Continued engagement and two-way 
transparency with these companies are vital to maintaining our 
competitive military edge and ensuring the Department has access to the 
nation's top technology and talent. We need to continue to message that 
the United States military is the most important global institution for 
the preservation and expansion of widely-shared values, including 
privacy, liberty, and equality. Communicating the key messages that the 
benefits of AI-enabled technologies include enhancing protection of 
U.S. and allied forces, reducing the potential for civilian casualties 
and collateral damage, and saving lives. One of our key missions in the 
JAIC is to build and strengthen relationships across U.S. AI technology 
hubs. The Department wants to work with those companies who will 
support the full range of DOD missions, while acknowledging that every 
company has an inherent right to rely on its own internal review 
mechanisms to decide on whether and how to work with DOD on AI-related 
projects.

    24. Senator Peters. Mr. Brown, I know DIU is trying to forge 
relationships with the private sector as well--do you see a way for us 
to work with private sector companies who at the corporate or employee 
level has expressed concern about working with the Department of 
Defense on our toughest military challenges?
    Mr. Brown. Transparent, open and frequent communications with 
industry, academia and the public will be critical to our success. DIU 
was designed to rebuild some of these bridges, develop new 
relationships and facilitate conversations that would have commercial 
solutions providers engage with the Department of Defense.
                      value of long term research
    25. Senator Peters. Dr. Highnam and Mr. Brown, there is a lot of 
understandable and deserved interest in the great advances that the 
commercial sector is making in AI. I know that the automotive industry 
is making great strides in developing new AI-enabled systems to support 
driverless cars and intelligent systems in traditional passenger cars. 
But I think that the Federal Government and this committee can play an 
important role in creating the environment and funding the research for 
that commercial innovation to thrive. Can you describe the role that 
federally-funded and university research plays in supporting commercial 
sector and Silicon Valley innovation, and what more should we be doing 
at the federal level to continue that support?
    Dr. Highnam. In terms of fostering commercial innovations in AI-
enabled systems, DARPA has historically played the role of making 
pivotal early technology investments in high risk, high payoff 
technologies. For example, DARPA's early investments in computer 
vision, machine learning, and autonomous control in the Grand Challenge 
and Urban Challenge programs spurred the development of technologies 
that led to the self-driving car technologies being pursued in the 
commercial sector today. (DARPA's earlier investments in the same 
technical areas in the early 1980s created the basis for the 
Challenges.) Given the growing role and importance of AI technologies 
in our daily life, fostering an even broader, more robust AI research 
ecosystem is an area where the Federal Government, including DARPA, can 
continue to play an important role by: 1) funding early stage research 
that inspires commercial application development; 2) funding academia 
to ensure a talent pipeline for commercial AI organizations; and 3) 
funding programs that address new or previously unrecognized research 
issues that often arise when technology meets real world deployments.
    Mr. Brown. Galvanizing a generational investment in science and 
technology is one of the most important proactive steps we can take in 
a technology race to ensure we reinforce the best aspects of U.S. 
innovation and entrepreneurial behavior. This requires a foundation of 
leading science and technology development and a return to the 
technology prominence the U.S. enjoyed in the 1960s--developed as a 
response to the previous tech race that we won. The nation, including 
the commercial technology ecosystems around the country, are still 
benefiting from the technology breakthroughs that came from this 
investment in basic science and research in the 1960s and 1970s 
(internet, GPS, semiconductors, etc.). The field of AI and Deep 
Learning in particular has advanced through public challenges such as 
ImageNet, which was hosted by Stanford University and got teams to 
compete on building algorithms to identify various images. DIU is 
building on this legacy with xView, a series of competitions that 
challenge participants to build algorithms applicable to human 
assistance and disaster response. The upcoming iteration of xView will 
challenge participants to build algorithms to do automated building 
damage assessment, which is critical in post-disaster environments. 
These challenges not only deliver cutting edge capabilities to the 
department, but also spur research interest in areas critical to DOD.
                              ai workforce
    26. Senator Peters. Lt. Gen. Shanahan, for us to move forward in AI 
we are going to need a workforce, both in uniform and on the civilian 
side, that is capable of being a smart user, buyer, regulator, and 
researcher of AI systems. What steps are you taking to build that 
workforce and do you need any special hiring, pay authorities or other 
authorities in order to compete for AI talent with the private sector?
    Lt. Gen. Shanahan. The JAIC is challenged with the hyper-
competitive market for top talent, specifically our difficulty in 
offering more competitive compensation packages. One of the key 
attributes of the Cyber Excepted Service (CES) is the Departments 
ability to offer more competitive market based compensation packages. 
While CES resolves many of the key issues, CES does not resolve all the 
concerns. To that end, the JAIC would benefit from Congressional 
assistance in the following two areas: Relief for the current federal 
pay cap ($166,500; Executive Level IV). Authorities to offer retention 
incentives internally to DOD employees. Specifically, we would benefit 
from the ability to offer incentives for DOD employees moving 
internally to the Department. Current authorities only allow for 
retention incentives to be given if the employee is leaving Government.
                   need for good data for ai systems:
    27. Senator Peters. Lt. Gen. Shanahan, AI and machine learning 
systems require data sets to learn from, and DOD often struggles in 
collecting, clean and useful data sets related to their challenges. AI 
and machine learning systems can only learn and be more useful if they 
are given raw material, namely data to process and work on to begin to 
better answer questions and perform required processes. But the 
government in general and DOD specifically has a reputation for not 
having good data on either its operational or back office systems and 
processes, and especially for not sharing that data with others. How is 
the JAIC working to create policies on the generation and sharing of 
data for AI systems to learn from and get better?
    Lt. Gen. Shanahan. Data is the fuel of AI. The Department 
recognizes that bad, dirty, or unshared data is a major impediment to 
implementing AI at scale. We need to move from a software-based to a 
data-first paradigm, refocusing on data as the product and establishing 
data-oriented architectures. With particular attention to designing AI-
ready data-driven workflows. Over the past year, the Office of the 
Chief Management Officer and OUSD (Comptroller) have been collaborating 
to extract, standardize, and curate data from the Department's 
operational and back office systems and processes. This data is now 
resident in the Defense Repository of Common Enterprise Data (DRCED) 
soon to be known as ADVANA. DRCED includes a detailed cost baseline of 
the Department's Reform Lines of Business, comprising 75 percent of the 
Department's unclassified budget. In addition to this catchment of 
data, DRCED provides users with a selection of tools for data 
wrangling, data analysis, and data visualization, and machine learning. 
As Project Maven demonstrated, and as we learned immediately with our 
initial two National Mission Initiatives (NMI), data management is one 
of the most resource-intensive and time-consuming aspects of the AI 
delivery pipeline. Success in any DOD AI project will rest on a 
foundation of good data management. We acknowledge the level of effort 
involved in improving DOD-wide data management; one of our key 
responsibilities within the JAIC will be to work closely with CMO and 
all other stakeholders to address and solve data management problems, 
and to serve as a central hub for helping the Services and Components 
do the same. This will include establishing standards, setting new 
policies, and providing the necessary authorities to begin to shift the 
Department in the right direction for future data management. For some 
systems, the processes are not yet ready for AI since they are not 
data-driven. We will work with our mission partners to design workflows 
that are data driven--where users visualize data to perform their tasks 
and record information during tasks. These systems can perform many 
task with many users across the operation units--aggregating 
information for each task level. We are adopting a user-based design 
principal for all of our systems--where end-users are engaged in 
designing, testing, and providing feedback so that the best AI-enabled 
delivery is possible. Once the user workflows are data driven, then AI 
can be added to augment the workflow. The JAIC will use tools, 
libraries, and framework resources provided by the JAIC Common 
Foundation (JCF) to build AI/ML to enhance the data driven workflows 
through our NMIs and CMIs. In addition, each NMI/CMI contributes to the 
data, models, libraries, and services in the JCF to be shared to the 
community at large
                        research community data
    28. Senator Peters. Dr. Highnam and Mr. Brown, I imagine the 
research community has challenges with accessing, maintaining, and 
sharing useful datasets, especially with respect to classified data. 
How do your research teams get the data they need to develop new AI 
systems and concepts and do we need to make any policy adjustments to 
make that more streamlined?
    Dr. Highnam. DARPA AI research programs often need data that may be 
unclassified or classified. In some cases, it may be possible for a new 
program to re-use existing data from other on-going or completed 
programs, and in some cases the new program may need to create new 
data. A special case arises when we need to generate unclassified 
synthetic data as a surrogate for classified real-world data in order 
to permit participation by researchers at universities. Separately, we 
anticipate that the recently established DOD Joint Artificial 
Intelligence Center (JAIC), with part of its mission to establish a 
common set of AI standards, tools, shared data, reusable technology, 
etc. will be a step towards improving accessibility of datasets to the 
AI research community. DARPA has a long history of working data issues 
and does not seek specific policy adjustments at this time.
    Mr. Brown. For machine learning efforts to be successful, large 
volumes of data are necessary to train algorithms. Large datasets do 
exist, but there are challenges leveraging them for a variety of 
reasons--some of which are cultural, some of which are regulatory. 
While we have the obligation to safeguard unauthorized disclosure of 
data, we also have an urgent need to bring machine learning 
capabilities into the Defense Department. We would welcome more 
comprehensive data-sharing agreements across DOD organizations to 
streamline data access challenges that often slow the development of 
critical technology. In addition, clearances pose a barrier to getting 
some of the best companies and people working on DOD's most important 
problems. Efforts to streamline and accelerate the clearance process 
would be beneficial.
